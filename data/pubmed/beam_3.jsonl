{"article": "symmetry transitions are common during embryogenesis of all multicellular organisms [ 14 ] . in most cases ,\nthe transition is from radial to bilateral symmetry and controlled by hox and decapentaplegic genes in animals [ 5 , 6 ] .\nin fact , the echinoderms provide the only reported example in which this order is reversed such that the radially symmetric animal develops from a bilaterally symmetric larvae stage [ 7 , 8 ] . in the model plant\narabidopsis thaliana , the gynoecium is derived from the fusion of two carpels and forms in the center of the flower . during gynoecium development , the apical style becomes radially symmetric with stigmatic papillae arising   ( figure  1a and figures s1a  s1c available online ) , suggesting the existence of a switch from bilateral to radial symmetry .\ngiven that the arabidopsis gynoecium originates from two fused leaves [ 11 , 12 ] , it is likely that factors involved in specifying leaf margin tissue are also regulated in the gynoecium . although margin identity genes may have a role in defining margins in the bilaterally symmetric ovary , we would expect such activities to be repressed in the style to achieve radial symmetry .\nkluh ( klu ) is a margin - identity gene expressed in peripheral cells of arabidopsis petals and in the marginal tissue of the gynoecium .\nexpression of klu::gus was detected along the entire length of developing gynoecia at stage 9 ( figure  1b ) but lost at the style of the mature gynoecium ( stage 12 in figure  1c ; developmental stages defined in ) .\nmutations in the spatula ( spt ) gene lead to a failure in radial symmetry establishment at the style   ( figures 1d and s1d  s1f ) .\ninterestingly , in the spt-12 mutant , klu::gus was still expressed in the apical medial part throughout gynoecium development ( figure  1e ) .\nthese results suggest that the bilateral - to - radial transition occurring during style formation requires transcriptional repression of margin - identity genes .\nwhen the spt mutant is combined with mutations in the indehiscent ( ind ) gene , the effect on style and stigma development is significantly enhanced reflecting the synergistic activities of these two basic helix - loop - helix transcription factors ( figures 1j and s1g  s1i ) . in the wild - type gynoecium\n, the ovary has a bilateral symmetry plane in which the septum divides the ovary into two separate locules , whereas the style is a rounded , compact , and radially symmetric structure ( figures 1g1i ) .\nspt and ind spt have defects in septum formation but maintain bilateral symmetry in the ovary ( figures 1j , 1l , s1j , and s1l ) .\nthe style in these mutants fails to acquire radial symmetry showing that ind and spt are required to ensure radial symmetry establishment at the gynoecium apex ( figures 1k and s1k ) .\nklu expression was found to be significantly upregulated in spt and ind spt mutants ( figure  1f ) and downregulated in a 35s::ind : gr line   induced by dexamethasone ( dex ) ( figure  s1n ) .\nthis is in agreement with a role of ind and spt in promoting radial symmetry , at least partially , by repressing margin identity .\nwe next tested whether ind and spt are sufficient to establish radial symmetry in an alternative developmental context such as a bilaterally symmetric flat leaf . to this end ,\nthe dex - inducible 35s::ind : gr line was grown on medium supplemented with dex . after 15  days , completely radialized leaves emerged as rod - like and cup - like structures ( figures 1 m , 1o , and s1 m ) .\nnotably , the epidermal cell shape of these radialized leaves is reminiscent of the shape of style cells ( figure  1s and inset 1s ) , which is in contrast to the normal jigsaw - shaped leaf epidermal cells from noninduced plants ( figure  1q ) .\nconversely , anatomical analyses of the internal cell types in cross - sections suggest that ind overexpression reprograms only the marginal cells ( figures s1p , s1r , s1 t , and s1v ) .\nthe ind - driven organ radialization was completely dependent on the presence of spt function , because the effect was lost in the spt-12 mutant background ( figures 1n , 1p , 1r , 1 t , s1q , s1s , s1u , and s1w ) .\naltogether , these results show that both ind and spt are necessary and sufficient for mediating organ radialization . during gynoecium development , auxin distribution\ntwo apical foci of the auxin - signaling reporter , dr5::gfp , are established in the lateral apical domains at early stages ( 5/6 ) of organ development ( figures 2a and 2b ) .\nsubsequently , two medial foci emerge at stage 8/9 ( figures 2c and 2d ; movie s1 ) , and immediately prior to formation of the style ( stage 10 ) , all four foci are connected in an auxin ring of radial symmetry ( figures 2e and 2f ) .\nthis pattern mimics the transition of bilateral - to - radial symmetry suggesting a role for the spatiotemporal dynamics of auxin in symmetry establishment .\nwe initially tested if the auxin - signaling foci are established by local auxin production .\nthe tryptophane aminotransferase of arabidopsis1 ( taa1 ) gene encodes an auxin - biosynthesis enzyme and is expressed in the same region as spt during early stages of gynoecium development ( figures s2a and s2b ) .\ntaa1 and its closest homolog tar2 likely regulate auxin dynamics in the gynoecium , because the taa1 tar2 double mutant exhibits a split - style phenotype .\nwe conducted the expression analysis of a taa1::taa1:gfp line concomitantly with dr5::rfp to correlate the dynamics of auxin production and auxin signaling in  vivo . early in development , expression of these two reporters is nonoverlapping with dr5::rfp in the apical lateral part and taa1::taa1:gfp in the medial region ( figure  s2b ) . at stage 9\n, there is overlap in the medial region with taa1::taa1:gfp expanding to the lateral adaxial side ( figure  s2c ) .\nbecause the dr5::rfp signal in the lateral foci appears before the taa1::taa1:gfp signal , it is unlikely that the two lateral auxin - signaling foci are established by local auxin synthesis .\nnext , we analyzed if auxin transport is involved in establishing the auxin - signaling foci .\nthe pin1 gene encodes a plasma membrane ( pm ) localized member of the pin auxin efflux family that directs polar auxin transport ( pat ) via their asymmetric subcellular localization [ 19 , 20 ] .\npin1 protein is located apically in cells of the ovary presumably to direct auxin flux from the base to the top of the developing gynoecium   ( figure  2 g ) . at the apex , pin1 localization becomes apolar primarily in the medial part of the gynoecium ( figure  2h ) .\npin1-mediated auxin transport is therefore likely to contribute to the specific pattern of auxin distribution at the apex . indeed , in gynoecia from a weak pin1 mutant allele ( pin1 - 5 ) , the intensity of the two lateral dr5::gfp foci are severely reduced and apical - basal polarity defects are detected ( figures s2d  s2f ) .\nan identical effect occurs in plants with mutations in the pinoid ( pid ) gene encoding an agc3-type protein kinase that promotes apical pin localization at the pm by phosphorylating specific serine residues in pin proteins [ 2124 ] ( figures 2 m , 2n , 2s , and 2u ) .\nindeed , mutations in two of those specific serine residues ( pin1:gfp s1,3a )   lead to apolar distribution of pin1 along the gynoecium ( figure  2i ) and apical - basal growth defects similar to the weak pid-8 mutant   ( figures 2 t and 2u ) . moreover , this growth - defective phenotype is reminiscent of treatment with the pat inhibitor npa [ 26 , 27 ] .\nanother member of the pin family , pin3 is initially confined to a few laterally positioned apical cells ( figure  2j ) overlapping with the lateral dr5::gfp foci ( figure  2a ) .\nlater , pin3 is detected throughout the apex in the same domain as dr5::gfp ( figures 2f and 2k ) with apolar localization of the protein ( figures 2j and 2k ) .\na third pin member , pin7 , is localized apolarly in a few medially positioned apical cells from around stage 7 ( figure  2l ) , presumably joining the activity of pin1 in establishing the medial foci . at later stages\n, pin7 is found throughout the apex sustaining the ring formation similarly to pin3 ( figure  s2 g ) .\nexpression and localization of pin1/pin3/pin7 suggests that pat mediates the transition from a bilaterally to a radially distributed auxin response ( figures 2a , 2b , 2e , and 2f ) .\nthe requirement for apolarly localized pins to establish the radial auxin maximum at the gynoecium apex resembles the apolar localization of pin4 around the quiescent center cells of the root apical meristem and its precursor cells during embryogenesis [ 28 , 29 ] . in this tissue ,\npin4 is necessary for the proper positioning of the auxin - response maximum at the embryo stem cell niche . to address the role of the lateral and medial pairs of auxin - signaling foci\n, we tested dr5 expression dynamics in mutants with defects in either apical - basal growth or style development .\ndr5::gfp in pin1 - 5 and dr5::rfp in pid-8 mutants showed a drastically decreased signal in the lateral foci , whereas the auxin ring appeared normally , thus correlating with radial style formation ( figures 2 m , 2n , 2p , 2q , 2u , and s2d  s2f ) .\nas in many organ - development processes , gynoecium growth along the apical - basal polarity axis follows the direction of auxin flux , directing growth toward the two lateral auxin foci providing cell and tissue polarity . in agreement with the reduced lateral dr5 signals , pin1 - 5 and\npid-8 mutants show apical - basal growth defects ( figures 2u and s2d ) . therefore , the two lateral foci are important to ensure apical - basal growth of the two carpels . in mutants with defects in the bilateral - to - radial symmetry transition ,\nthe two lateral dr5 foci are correctly established early during gynoecium development , and these mutants have no apparent apical - basal defects ( figures 2v , s1j , and s2h ) .\nin contrast , the medial dr5 foci were not established in these mutant backgrounds ( figures 2o and s2i ) and the dr5 ring fails to form ( figures 2r and s2j ) .\nthe lack of dr5::rfp in spt-12 is unlikely to be due to lack of auxin biosynthesis , because taa1::taa1:gfp is still expressed in spt-12 ( figure  s2k ) .\nthese results suggest that the medial auxin - signaling foci promote the bilateral - to - radial symmetry switch . in agreement with this ,\nthe medial dr5 foci form normally in pid-8 gynoecia with no defect in establishing the dr5 ring and correlating with formation of a radial style ( figures 2n and 2q ) .\nit was previously shown that spt and ind directly repress pid expression [ 15 , 16 ] .\naccordingly , we found that a pid::gus reporter was ectopically expressed in the style region of the spt-12 mutant compared to wild - type ( figures 3a and 3b ) .\nthe importance of apolar pin1 localization was analyzed by expressing a version of pin1 that mimics constitutive phosphorylation of the three serine residues targeted by pid ( pin1:gfp s1,2,3e ) in the pin1 mutant background .\ngynoecia from this line exhibited a split - style phenotype similar to the spt-12 mutant ( figures 1d , 3c , and 3f ) .\ninterestingly pin1:gfp s1,2,3e protein could not be detected at the apex as opposed to a nonmutated pin1:gfp version ( figures 3d and 3e ) , suggesting that apical localization renders pin1 unstable in this tissue .\nconsistent with defective pin1:gfp s1,2,3e protein localization , dr5::rfp was not detected in the medial foci of pin1:gfp s1,2,3e pin1 ( figure  3i ) but only in the lateral foci , thereby resembling dr5 distribution in spt and ind spt mutants ( figures 2o , 2r , and s2h  s2j ) .\nthese results suggest that pid - mediated phosphorylation of pin1 is sufficient to prevent radial symmetry .\nas expected , loss of pin1 phosphorylation had no effect on radial symmetry establishment , because constitutive apolar localization of the pin1:gfp s1,3a mutant protein sustains apolar auxin flux ( figures 3 g , 3h , s3a , and s3b ) .\ntogether , these results show that apolar localization of pin1 is required for radial style formation .\nwe next tested the developmental relevance of the sequential appearance of the lateral and medial pairs of foci .\nthe gynoecium phenotype resulting from crosses between pid loss - of - function mutants and spt-12 was analyzed to distinguish between two possible scenarios : ( 1 ) if activity of the medial foci is sufficient for radial symmetry establishment , complementation of the spt split - style phenotype was expected by eliminating pid function and ( 2 ) if the role of lateral foci is functionally upstream of the medial foci , a failure to establish radial style development was expected in the double mutant .\nanalysis of the pid-8 spt-12 and pid-9 spt-12 double mutants revealed a strong enhancement of the spt-12 phenotype and a complete failure in radial symmetry establishment .\nthis result is in agreement with the second scenario and suggests that the lateral foci are required to support the role of the medial foci during style development ( figures 3j , s3e , and s3f ) . to study whether the split - style phenotype in spt gynoecia is due to a failure of spt in controlling auxin transport in the medial apex , we introgressed the pin1::pin1:gfp s1,3a loss - of - phosphorylation mutant into spt-12 . here\n, the background was kept wild - type for the endogenous pin1 gene to sustain formation of the lateral foci and promote apical - basal growth .\ngynoecia from this genetic combination exhibited complete restoration of the split defect with perfectly radialized styles ( figures 3k , s3c , and s3 g ) .\nthis was dependent on wild - type endogenous pin1 in the background , because gynoecia from the pin1::pin1:gfp s1,3a spt-12 pin1 triple combination phenocopied spt pid double mutant gynoecia ( figures 3j and 3l ) .\nas with the spt pid double mutants , this triple combination was unable to sustain the apical - basal growth , thus affecting the activity of the lateral foci and enhancing the spt phenotype ( figures 3l , s3d , and s3h ) .\noverall , these results show that spt ( and ind ) controls radiality at the gynoecium apex by controlling auxin transport , thus governing auxin flux in the medial region of the style .\nthey also reveal that activity of the medial foci is linked to and dependent on the lateral auxin - signaling foci .\nthe functional relation between the lateral and medial auxin - signaling foci described here is closely aligned with the stereotypical stages occurring during gynoecium development . as indicated in figure  4 ,\nthe early function of the lateral foci is to sustain apical - basal growth allowing to build up the ovary .\nsubsequently , at stages 8 and 9 , in order to obtain a radialized apical style , spt and ind establish the medial foci by directly repressing pid expression [ 15 , 16 ] , thus sustaining apolar pin localization and auxin accumulation ( figure  4 ) .\nit is unknown what stimulates expression of the ind / spt module , but it is an intriguing possibility that a feedback mechanism exists between ind / spt and auxin . finally , we hypothesize that a long - distance signal is required to connect the different foci in a radial auxin - signaling maximum to achieve a switch in cell polarity and thus orchestrating the coordinated growth of the radial style to facilitate fertilization .\nexcellent progress has been made in understanding how auxin provides polarity and identity to cells in a range of developmental contexts .\nthe example presented here demonstrates that auxin can also be recruited to coordinate a heterogeneous group of cells to commit to a program , which imposes homogeneous identity to them .\nthis activity leads to an unusual developmental bilateral - to - radial symmetry transition in the arabidopsis style .\nthe radial style is a general feature of the female reproductive organ in angiosperms , which arose during the cretaceous period 100125 million years ago .\nthe early angiosperms underwent a remarkably rapid diversification and have since reached ecological domination in the plant kingdom in terms of number of species ( > 300,000 ) a phenomenon that charles darwin referred to as  the abominable mystery  . because a radial style is necessary to facilitate efficient fertilization , radialization of the style may have been a key event in allowing the success of flowering plants .\nconceived the hypothesis and planned the experiments , l.m . carried out the experimental work , and l.m . and l. .", "human": " summarysymmetry formation is a remarkable feature of biological life forms associated with evolutionary advantages and often with great beauty . \n several examples exist in which organisms undergo a transition in symmetry during development  [ 14 ] . \n such transitions are almost exclusively in the direction from radial to bilateral symmetry [ 58 ] . here \n , we describe the dynamics of symmetry establishment during development of the arabidopsis gynoecium . \n we show that the apical style region undergoes an unusual transition from a bilaterally symmetric stage ingrained in the gynoecium due to its evolutionary origin to a radially symmetric  structure . \n we also identify two transcription factors , indehiscent [ 9 ] and spatula [ 10 ] , that are both necessary and sufficient for the radialization process . \n our work furthermore shows that these two transcription factors control style symmetry by directly regulating auxin distribution . \n establishment of specific auxin - signaling foci and the subsequent development of a radially symmetric auxin ring at the style are required for the transition to radial symmetry , because genetic manipulations of auxin transport can either cause loss of radialization in a wild - type background or rescue mutants with radialization defects . whereas many examples have described how auxin provides polarity and specific identity to cells in a range of developmental contexts , our data presented here demonstrate that auxin can also be recruited to impose uniform identity to a group of cells that are otherwise differentially programmed .

{"article": "be that as it may , 5% of all cases of syncope are usually of cardiac origins and are thus known as cardiac syncope .\npulmonary embolism is a relatively rare cause of cardiac syncope , which may explain why it is frequently ignored.1 the variability of presentation sets the patient and clinician up for potentially missing the diagnosis .\npresentation with abrupt onset of pleuritic chest pain , shortness of breath , and hypoxia is rarely the case .\nstudies of patients who die unexpectedly of pulmonary embolism reveal that they complained of nagging symptoms often for weeks before death related to pulmonary embolism .\nforty percent of these patients had been seen by a physician in the weeks prior to their death.2 when syncope is the presenting symptom of pulmonary embolism , it should raise the clinical suspicion for a massive clot burden or saddle embolism requiring prompt treatment .\na 52-year -

tpa ) 100 mg over a 90-minute period , which brought about immediate improvement in the patient s condition .\nthe following day , his symptoms improved dramatically , his respiratory rate decreased , his o2 saturation rose from 85% to 98% , and his blood pressure remained stable in different positions .\nct angiography showed improved right ventricular function and decreased right ventricular size and pulmonary arteries ( figures 4&5 ) .\nthe diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism is amongst the most challenging problems encountered in clinical practice . despite the awareness amongst physicians of the risks associated with a delay in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism ,\nit was not initially considered in this case because of the following reasons : firstly , syncope is an uncommon presentation of pulmonary embolism , occurring in only 14% of patients .\nthe most common symptoms are dyspnea ( 82% ) , pleuritic chest pain ( 49% ) , and cough ( 20%).3 secondly , the patient had no history of deep vein thrombosis .\nthe exact number of the symptoms and signs of deep vein thrombosis in patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is not clear , but one study reported deep vein thrombosis in 62% of patients with pulmonary embolism.4 and thirdly , our patient had severe right ventricular enlargement with severe trabeculations .\nthe occurrence of non - sustained ventricular tachycardia in the exercise test gave rise to other diagnoses , including arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia , which justifies the syncope and right ventricular dilation .\nalthough arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is more common in younger patients , we considered it as one possible diagnosis because of the patient s having developed non - sustained ventricular tachycardia during the exercise test and his dilated right ventricle with trabeculations.5 the patient experienced three episodes of presyncope in the ccu , but his rhythm during these episodes was sinus bradycardia .\nwe concluded that ventricular tachycardia was not the mechanism of syncope / presyncope and performed ct angiography to confirm pulmonary embolism as the culprit for the syncope .\nthe patient had a weak family history of pulmonary embolism , hinting at the presence of hypercoagulable states such as activated protein c ( apc ) resistance , factor v leiden , anti thrombin iii deficiency , and protein c and s deficiency .\nfor the evaluation of hypercoagulable states , family history remains the most rapid and cost - effective method of identifying a predisposition to venous thrombosis.6 whereas management with anticoagulants alone is typically sufficient for low - risk patients , more aggressive treatments such as thrombolysis , embolectomy , and inferior vena cava ( ivc ) filters are recommended for higher - risk patients .\nthrombolytic therapy should be considered in all patients with massive pulmonary embolism and hypotension associated with deep vein thrombosis in the popliteal area or higher.7 the main indications for thrombolytic therapy include ongoing hypoxia , respiratory distress , pulmonary hypertension , and right heart failure because thrombolytic therapy often achieves an impressive and almost an immediate clinical benefit in these clinical settings.8 the patient s right ventricular failure and progressive course prompted us to candidate him for thrombolysis .\nthe other option in management would have been embolectomy , which is performed either with a catheter or during open heart surgery .\nembolectomy via open surgery is reported to have improved the survival rate to 89% in twenty - nine emergent pulmonary embolism cases.9 although interventional catheter - based catheter fragmentation and suction embolectomy are also available for pulmonary embolectomy in some institutions , open surgical embolectomy is indicated in patients who have contraindications to thrombolytic therapy , persistence of thrombi in the right heart or pulmonary arteries after pulmonary embolism , or severe hemodynamic compromise with cardiovascular collapse .\nearly surgical treatment must also be considered in patients whose course deteriorates in spite of aggressive medical therapy depending on the series .\nthe overall mortality rate after pulmonary embolectomy varies from 16% to 46% , with a mean mortality rate of 26% .\nthese findings suggest that earlier surgical intervention may result in improved survival.10 we can conclude that surgical embolectomy is warranted in patients with severe hemodynamic instability on the basis of clinical impression , after other causes of hemodynamic collapse have been ruled out .\nan experimental catheter embolectomy used in cardiac catheterization appears promising.11 ivc filters are an appropriate option for patients with high bleeding risks . the insertion rate of ivc filters has increased in recent years ; this increase , however , has occurred without proven improved safety and efficiency.12 another important point in the management of this patient was the optimal duration of anticoagulation . despite the fact that the patient had a weak family history of hypercoagulable states , a proper course of action required his management as a case of idiopathic venous thromboemboli and with an indefinite duration of oral anticoagulant ( warfarin ) therapy.13", "human": " a pulmonary embolus clogs the artery that provides blood supply to a part of the lung . \n the embolus not only prevents the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide but also decreases blood supply to the lung tissue itself , potentially causing the tissue to die ( infarct ) . a 52-year -

furthermore , it is rapidly growing and has very small conidiospores ( 35  m ) .\nthese include melanin and a hydrophobic protein - coat layer on the surface of conidia that may help to protect them against recognition , ingestion and/or elimination by complement and phagocytes [ 1014 ] .\nvarious proteases that may help to pass tissue barriers and to degrade proteins of the immune response are secreted by the fungus [ 1517 ] , and mycotoxins like gliotoxin might also contribute to undermine the host defence [ 1820 ] .  \nthe most important path of aspergillus infections is via inhalation of the conidia into the respiratory tract .\nas conidia of pathogenic aspergillus species are very small , they can be inhaled deeply into the lung and even into the pulmonary alveoli . in immunocompetent individuals , conidia are effectively phagocytosed and eliminated by alveolar macrophages and infiltrating neutrophils [ 12 , 21 , 22 ] , but in the case of immunologic deficits ,\nthey are able to germinate and to penetrate the lung tissue , thus causing an invasive pulmonary aspergillosis . infections of the lung are the by far most frequent type of ia . by penetration of blood vessels\n, aspergillus can disseminate and invade other organs , including the heart , the liver , and the central nervous system ( cns ) .\ncerebral aspergillosis occurs in 10%20% of all cases of ia and thus is the most common extrapulmonary form .\nneuropathologic features include hemorrhagic infarcts and/or necrosis , vascular thrombosis , meningitis , granuloma , and formation of solitary as well as multiple abscesses [ 6 , 2325 ] . according to the division of bacterial and mycotic diseases ( dbmd ) , the incidence of aspergillosis is 1 - 2 per 100,000 per year .\nincidence rates of ia in high - risk populations depend on the respective group and rise up to 24% in patients with prolonged and profound neutropenia .\nfurthermore , ia is the most expensive opportunistic infection in immunosuppressed patients , with annual treating costs in europe of approximately  200 million . in -\nhospital stays complicated by ia cause additional costs of  75,000 per patient .   despite antimycotic therapy and surgical interventions ,\nthe fatality of ia is high and depends on the degree of immunosuppression and on the affected organs . without treatment , the mortality is nearly 100% , while under treatment the overall case - fatality rate is nearby 60% and rises to more than 90% in cases of cns aspergillosis [ 1 , 6 , 26 ] .\ncomplement consists of approximately 30 fluid - phase and membrane - bound proteins that cooperate to form the cascade .\nregulatory factors control and modulate its activity , and cellular receptors mediate the interaction between complement factors and immune cells . representing a potent component of the innate host defence and an interface to adaptive immunity\nthe most outstanding roles are the direct and indirect defence against infections , the stimulation and regulation of b- and t - cell response , and the disposal of debris [ 2731 ] .\nhepatocytes are the main producers of complement factors ; however , several other cell types participate in the synthesis .\nactivation of the complement system is triggered by a multiplicity of  danger signals ,  such as pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) , antigen / antibody complexes , and the presence of transformed cells , apoptotic cells , or cell debris .\nthree different activation pathways start the complement cascade , all of them resulting in the cleavage of the central complement factor c3 by proteolytic enzyme complexes ( c3 convertases ) , and subsequently leading to the common terminal pathway ( figure 1 ) . in the classical pathway , binding of complement factor c1q to immunoglobulin class g or m ( igg , igm ) of antigen - antibody complexes represents the initial step .\nalternatively , the globular heads of c1q can interact with microbial surfaces that had been covered by pentraxins , a class of soluble pattern recognition molecules .\nthe thereby induced conformational changes of c1q subsequently activate the associated proteases c1r and c1s , which cleave the factors c4 and c2 .\nthe resulting fragments form the c3 convertase c4b2a .   in the lectin pathway , foreign carbohydrate molecules on the surface of pathogens are recognized by mannose - binding lectin ( mbl ) or the related ficolins .\nmbl - associated serine proteases ( masps ) cleave c4 and c2 , and the fragments build up the c3 convertase c4b2a , which is identically equal to the one of the classical pathway .\nficolin-2 can also interact with pentraxin - covered microbes , thus starting the lectin pathway in an alternative manner .\ninterestingly , mbl was recently described to support c3 cleavage by a c2 bypass mechanism , which results in activation of the alternative pathway .\nthe alternative pathway is triggered via activating foreign surfaces and creates an amplification loop by spontaneous reaction of c3 with h2o ( c3(h2o ) ) ; alternatively , c3b generated by the other pathways represents the starting trigger .\nsurface - bound c3b associates with factor b , which is then cleaved by the plasma serine protease factor d. these steps result in the formation of the c3 convertase c3bbb [ 27 , 36 ] .  \nproteolytic cleavage of c3 by one of the c3 convertases is the common and central step of all three activation pathways .\nthis split generates the fragments c3a and c3b , which are two important components that mediate a multitude of complement functions ( see below ) .\nthe product c3b associates with the c3 convertases , thus forming the c5 convertases , which cleave factor c5 into c5a and c5b .\nthis step initiates a chain of assembly processes of the proteins c6 , c7 , c8 , and c9 .\nthe bound and polymerized c9 units create the terminal complement complex ( tcc ) that can form a pore in the target lipid bilayer , called membrane attack complex ( mac ) . targeted\ncells , bacteria and viruses die or are inactivated by efficient disruption of the membrane integrity [ 31 , 37 ] . beneath the mac formation and direct pathogen destruction\n, complement displays several additional antimicrobial mechanisms aiming to neutralize invading microbes and to restore body homeostasis .\nsurface - bound c3b undergoes internal cleavage steps ; the derived products ic3b , c3d , and further , coat and label the pathogens for phagocytosis ( opsonization ) .\neffector cells with specific membrane - bound complement receptors ( crs ) recognize the opsonizing complement fragments , ingest the labeled pathogens , and eliminate them .\nfurthermore , the interaction of the opsonized particles with cr - bearing immune cells results in their activation and their increased proliferation .\nthe receptor cr3 , a heterodimer of cd11b and cd18 , is regarded to be the most important mediator for complement - driven phagocytosis .\nbeing expressed on phagocytes like dendritic cells , neutrophils , macrophages , and microglia , it interacts with ic3b on the pathogen [ 27 , 38 ] .\nthe complement receptors cr3 and cr4 allow adhesion of cells to cells of the same and other cell types , respectively , ( homotypic and heterotypic adhesion ) .\nimmune cells can bind via these receptors to their ligands on endothelium of the blood vessels , a prerequisite for penetration through the vessel wall into the tissue and migration to the site of infection and inflammation .\nsurface - bound ic3b can be further cleaved proteolytically to generate the opsonizing fragment c3d .\nbinding of c3d - opsonised pathogens to the corresponding complement receptor cr2 ( cd35 ) on b cells induces cross - linkage with the b cell receptor complex , a process that lowers the threshold for b cell activation by the specific antigen by several orders of magnitude .\ncleavage of c3 and c5 generate the potent anaphylatoxins c3a and c5a , respectively , which exert several biological functions by binding to their corresponding cellular receptors c3ar , c5ar ( cd88 ) , and c5l2 .\nthey provoke chemotactic attraction of immune cells to the site of infection and an increase of vascular permeability [ 40 , 41 ] . furthermore , c3a and c5a trigger an efficient proinflammatory response by stimulating cytokine synthesis and secretion [ 40 , 41 ] .\nvarious cell types harboring the corresponding anaphylatoxin receptors on their surface react on ligand binding with cell activation , stimulation of cell specific signaling pathways , or of oxidative burst [ 27 , 42 ] .  \nthe complement cascade needs a tight control to prevent host damage by cell / tissue lysis and excessive inflammation .\na variety of both soluble and membrane - bound regulators can influence all steps of the complement cascade , with the c3/c5 convertases as main control targets [ 27 , 37 , 4345 ] . under normal conditions\n, these regulators should protect all body cells against auto - attack by the complement system .  \nthe serine protease factor i cleaves both c4b and c3b and is thereby supported by various cofactor molecules .\nc4 binding protein ( c4  bp ) and factor h ( fh ) are fluid - phase proteins that enable the cleavage of c4b and c3b , respectively , moreover , the membrane - anchored molecules complement receptor 1 ( cr1 , cd35 ) and membrane cofactor protein ( mcp , cd46 ) support the degradation of both c3b and c4b .\nin addition , fh and c4  bp accelerate the decay of assembled c3 convertase ; cr1 affects both c3 and c5 convertases .\ndecay accelerating factor ( daf , cd55 ) is another notable membrane - bound regulator that efficiently prevents the assembly and promotes the disintegration of both c3 and c5 convertases [ 27 , 4345 ] .   in the terminal pathway\n, the membrane - anchored cd59 ( protectin ) binds to c8 in the c5b-8 complex and thus inhibits further incorporation and polymerization of c9 units to form the mac [ 27 , 4345 ] .\nthe potency of complement represents a valuable tool to attack invading pathogens and to defend the host against penetration and dissemination .\none particular advantage of complement lies in the fact that activation can start within seconds after contact with the microbe and ends with a multifaceted spectrum of antimicrobial reactions .\nhowever , the fact that microbial infections occur in a considerable proportion , already implicates that the pathogens have developed appropriate counterstrategies to avoid elimination , thus starting a vicious circle of reaction and counterreaction .\nfurthermore , the antimicrobial effector mechanisms of the complement system might also harbour harmful consequences for the affected host . as known from several infectious and noninfectious diseases , chronic or exceeding complement - mediated inflammation\nputative mechanisms for such complement - induced tissue damage may include a fulminant inflammatory reaction and opsonization of surrounding  bystander  cells with subsequent lysis .\n\n aspergillus conidia and hyphae activate the complement system via all three pathways [ 4648 ] ( figure 1 ) .\ninitiation of the complement cascade by resting conidia is mediated predominantly by the alternative pathway .\nhowever , when the conidia begin to swell and transform into hyphae , there is a progressive involvement of the classical pathway .\nthese differences in the activation pathways are reflected by different kinetics ; the slowest initiation is seen with resting conidia .\nfurthermore , mbl as a pattern recognition molecule of the lectin pathway is able to bind to carbohydrate structures on the surface of aspergillus and promotes complement activation via the lectin pathway , which results in the deposition of c4 . as mentioned above\n, mbl can support c3 cleavage by a c2 bypass mechanism after contact with a. fumigatus conidia , resulting in activation of the alternative pathway and avoiding formation of the classical pathway c3 convertase .\nthis mechanism is not restricted to a. fumigatus , but can also take place in the presence of a. terreus , a. niger , and a. flavus .  \nmbl generally seems to be a molecule of high significance for innate defence against a range of pathogens . in several studies\n, it was shown to bind to various sugars on the surfaces of viruses , bacteria , yeasts , fungi , and protozoa [ 4851 ] .\nfurther evidence for the crucial role of mbl arises from findings in patients with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis and mouse models of pulmonary aspergillosis [ 52 , 53 ] ; these facts suggest mbl as a promising molecule for prophylaxis and therapeutical treatment ( see below ) .  \na further mechanism for complement activation driven by aspergillus involves the interaction with the pattern recognition molecule pentraxin-3 ( ptx-3 ) .\nwhen a. fumigatus is opsonized with ptx-3 , the complement cascade can be activated either by interaction between ptx-3 and c1q via the classical pathway , or by interaction between ptx-3 and ficolin-2 via the lectin pathway .\nafter seroconversion , anti - aspergillus antibodies in the serum can trigger the start of the classical complement pathway .\nthe thesis that complement represents a central tool in antifungal host defence is supported by several findings .\nfurthermore , recognition by the complement system and activation of the cascade seems to interfere with efficient dissemination in the host .\nthis conclusion is strongly indicated by the fact that the level of complement deposition on different aspergillus species correlates inversely with their pathogenicity : highly virulent species like a. fumigatus and a. flavus bind less c3 on their surface than nonpathogenic species like a. glaucus or a. nidulans .\nthe antimicrobial potency of the complement cascade appears to be independent from direct killing via formation of a mac ; presumably , the thick fungal cell wall block the formation of a pore by the c9 polymers and the subsequent lysis of the cells .\nopsonization of the fungal surface with c3-derived fragments are presumably the most relevant complement - associated weapon , stimulating efficient phagocytosis or release of damaging compounds , oxidative burst and killing by monocytes , bronchoalveolar macrophages , and polymorphonuclear cells [ 46 , 47 , 57 ] .\nthe capacity to opsonize pathogens and to exert antifungal effects strictly depends on the available complement levels in the respective compartment of the body .\nthe complement concentrations in the central nervous system ( cns ) are low and thus only allow a rather weak deposition .\nconsequently , the complement amounts in the cerebrospinal fluid are unable to induce a significant oxidative burst in immune cells and to result in reduced fungal viability , thus making the cns a highly vulnerable organ . however , the brain cells react to the fungal presence with an upregulation of complement synthesis to enable better opsonization and therefore a more efficient clearance of the fungus .  \nmice deficient in complement factor c5 can exert the early opsonization processes with c3 fragments , but are unable to fulfil the complete cascade . when infected with a. fumigatus ,\nthese mice show decreased resistance and lower 50% lethal conidia dosage for a disseminated infection [ 59 , 60 ] .\nsince this enhanced susceptibility is unlikely to be due to absent mac formation in the fungal cell membrane , it might be supposed that the inability to form the anaphylatoxin c5a could be the relevant deficit in these mice [ 59 , 60 ] .\nc5a exerts a wide range of proinflammatory effects ; by binding to its receptor c5ar , c5a recruits inflammatory cells to the site of infection , enhances cellular adhesion , and stimulates oxidative metabolism .\nin addition , c5a can trigger the release of lysosomal enzymes and of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf- ) and interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) [ 61 , 62 ] .\nfurthermore , a higher susceptibility to aspergillosis in c5-deficient mice might be attributed to missing tcc .\nlow doses of this soluble complex were shown to bind to the membrane of a range of cell types , thereby triggering various effects like activation , rescue from apoptosis , and secretion of prostaglandins , which are important regulators of the immune response [ 6367 ] .\nthe potency of aspergillus to cope with the complement system and to undermine its mechanisms for elimination determines how successful the fungus can establish an infection .\naspergillus has developed a complex repertoire of effector mechanisms for this purpose ( table 1 ) .  \nsingle or multiple abscess formation is a characteristic feature of aspergillosis , particularly in the central nervous system ( cns ) .\nthe fungal hyphae are found in brain blood , vessels with invasion through vascular walls into adjacent parenchymal tissue .\nfungal brain abscesses may arise from these sites of localized parenchymal infection . in this case , white blood cells collect in the affected part of the brain , and fibrous tissue forms around this area , creating a mass .\ncns abscesses typically present with headache , focal neurological abnormalities , and/or seizure , which is the consequence of local destruction or compression of adjacent brain tissue .\nmature fungal abscesses exhibit a central necrotic area with fungal hyphae , surrounded by a capsule of newly formed fibrous tissue .\nthe formation of abscesses represents a host mechanism to inhibit further spreading of invading pathogens .\nhowever , this  sealing off  not only inhibits fungal dissemination , but also forms some kind of protection shields against the complement attack .\nimmunohistochemical staining revealed that effect : whereas the fibrous surrounding tissue was intensely stained for complement proteins , the central necrotic area contained only minor complement concentrations .\nno deposition of complement factors on the fungal surface in the abscess was visible , implying that the encapsulation protects the fungus within the abscess from any efficient complement attack .\nputative complement recognition sites on the conidial surface of a. fumigatus are optimally masked to minimize the stimulus for complement activation .\nexperiments aiming to identify the relevant fungal structure indicated that melanin could play a substantial role for masking ; for this purpose , knock out mutants lacking enzymes of the melanin biosynthesis pathway were used [ 10 , 11 , 76 ] .\ndisruption of the gene alb1 , which encodes a polyketide synthase in the synthesis of melanin , results in increased opsonization of the conidia with c3 and in a better ingestion by human neutrophils .\ndeposition of pigments on the conidial surface might mask the c3 binding sites , and disruption of the alb1 gene might expose these sites and thus allow enhanced c3 binding .\na mouse model confirms this function of alb1 in fungal pathogenesis , since the alb1-deficient mutant of a. fumigatus turned out to be less virulent than the wild - type fungus [ 11 , 76 ] .\ninactivation of the gene for the pigmentation protein arp1 similarly increased the deposition of c3 on conidia .\nthis pigment seems to be a central element of aspergillus against the host defence , as it is also involved in scavenging reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and inhibits the acidification of phagolysosomes of alveolar macrophages , monocyte - derived macrophages , and human neutrophil granulocytes after ingestion of conidia [ 12 , 13 , 77 ] .\nas mentioned above , the activity of the complement cascade is strictly limited by several fluid - phase inhibitors .\nimmunofluorescence analysis , adsorption assays and flow cytometry studies showed that aspergillus acquires fh , factor h - like protein 1 ( fhl-1 ) , factor h - related protein 1 ( fhr-1 ) , and c4  bp from the host [ 70 , 71 ] .\nfhl-1 is a splicing product of the fh gene , and fhr-1 is a related protein belonging to the fh family .\nbound to the conidial surface , fh maintained its regulatory activity and could act as a cofactor for the factor i - mediated cleavage of c3b .\nas a consequence of covering the fungal surface with these complement inhibitors , all three pathways might be downmodulated .\nthe attachment molecules on aspergillus are not yet known , whereas the corresponding binding regions within fh were recently described .\none of them was identified within n - terminal short consensus repeats ( scrs ) 1 to 7 and a second one within c - terminal scr 20 . \n\na. fumigatus not only acquires complement inhibitors from the host , but also produces and releases its own soluble factor that inhibits complement activation and opsonization of the fungus [ 72 , 73 ] .\nthis complement inhibitor ( ci ) , which is also synthesized by a. flavus , selectively abolishes activation of the alternative pathway and interferes with c3b - dependent phagocytosis and killing .\nthe exact chemical composition of ci is as yet unknown ; it contains 15% protein and 5% polysaccharide .\nrecent own results raise the possibility that this described ci or a closely related activity also contributes to the pathogenesis in cerebral aspergillosis , since immunohistochemical studies show deposition of c1q and c4 , but not of c3 , on the fungal hyphae in the cns .  \nstudies by sturtevant revealed the synthesis of a proteolytic enzyme that is able to degrade c3 ( , reviewed in : ) .\nthis is confirmed by own experiments showing complement - degrading proteolysis in the supernatant of aspergillus when grown in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) .\nthe fungus - induced degradation of complement in csf evoked a drastic reduction of the opsonization of the fungal hyphae . in parallel ,\nthe fungal serine protease alp1 might participate in complement degradation and thus be partly responsible for the complement evasion [ 15 , 17 ] . to date , degradation of c1q , c3 ,\nc4 , c5 , mbl , and factor d were shown [ 15 , 17 ] .\nthe high morbidity and lethality of invasive aspergillosis strongly demands for an expansion of the current treatment options . the antimycotic therapy might be completed by new approaches aiming to strengthen the host immune response against the fungus .\nputative approaches could be to increase the available complement concentrations or to improve the efficiency of complement attack by undermining the fungal evasion strategies .\nappropriate strategies that target the complement system may aim to the following .   our own studies about cerebral aspergillosis showed a clear correlation between the complement levels in the csf and the capacity of csf to opsonize fungal hyphae and designate them for phagocytic killing\n. a therapeutic increase of mbl concentrations in invasive aspergillosis might be an appropriate approach , since patients with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis show more frequently mbl haplotypes that encode for low levels of the protein than healthy control persons .\nfurther support comes from a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis : those mice with externally administered recombinant mbl reveal better survival , compared to untreated animals .\ndetailed studies confirmed that mbl - treated mice show a significant increase in the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf- and il-1 , together with a marked decrease of anti - inflammatory il-10 and of fungal hyphae in the lung .\nblocking of the fungal surface pigments by specific antibodies or peptides might be a hypothetical approach that could help to expose the c3 binding sites and thus improve complement deposition and ingestion of conidia by phagocytes .\nanother approach might target the acquisition of the negative complement regulators fh , fhl-1 , and c4  bp to the fungal surface . for candida albicans , some molecules that bind c4b and fh\nhave recently been identified [ 78 , 79 ] , while the attachment sites on aspergillus are still unknown but might include related molecules .\nblocking antibodies , designed peptides or other inhibitors against these complement regulator binding molecules might help to make the fungus more vulnerable towards complement attack .\na similar approach might be developed for the aspergillus - derived complement inhibitor described by washburn [ 72 , 73 ] .  \n\nour own results open the possibility to neutralize the fungal protease(s ) that is / are secreted by aspergillus to degrade complement proteins .\ntwo different strategies were tested by first in vitro experiments : the neutralization of the protease by specific inhibitors or interference with the production of this proteolytic enzyme . in our studies , we could prevent the complement degrading activity by serine protease inhibitors\n. however , a therapeutically used protease inhibitor must be highly specific , since a general block of serine proteases might be fatal for the host .\nalternatively , our experiments exhibited that the secretion of complement - degrading enzymes strictly depends on the availability of nitrogen sources .\nthus , the supply of amino acids in the infected host might downmodulate the secretion of the relevant fungal protease that cleaves the complement factors of the host .\ndespite new antifungal drugs and improved medical treatment , invasive aspergillosis remains a dangerous threat for immunocompromised patients , as the innate immune defence is the most crucial weapon against this infection .\nthe complement system is of particular importance , as it harbours multiple effects against infectious diseases , bridges the elements of the human defence network by a multitude of factors , and helps to preserve the homeostasis of the body .\nthe presence of fungal pathogens is detected by different pattern recognition molecules ; three pathways guarantee the activation of the complement cascade by resting , swollen , and germinating conidia as well as by hyphae of aspergillus .\ndirect lysis of fungal cells by the membrane attach complex ( mac ) appears to be of minor importance for the antifungal defence .\npresumably , attraction and activation of immune cells ( monocytes , pulmonary macrophages , and polymorphonuclear neutrophils ) are the most essential mechanisms .\nanaphylatoxins ( c3a , c5a ) chemotactically recruit immune cells to the site of the infection and induce further inflammatory reactions .\nopsonization of conidia and hyphae with complement fragments like c3b and ic3b mediate phagocytosis , oxidative burst , and release of damaging compounds by binding to corresponding receptors on immune cells\n. however , highly virulent aspergillus species have evolved mechanisms to evade the attack by complement .\nthey hide from recognition , acquire complement regulatory molecules from the host , and secrete proteases to degrade complement factors .  \nthe multifaceted interactions between complement and aspergillus represent promising approaches for future therapeutic strategies that may help to improve the outcome of invasive aspergillosis .", "human": " invasive aspergillosis shows a high mortality rate particularly in immunocompromised patients . perpetually increasing numbers of affected patients highlight the importance of a clearer understanding of interactions between innate immunity and fungi . \n innate immunity is considered to be the most significant host defence against invasive fungal infections . \n complement represents a crucial part of this first line defence and comprises direct effects against invading pathogens as well as bridging functions to other parts of the immune network . \n however , despite the potency of complement to attack foreign pathogens , the prevalence of invasive fungal infections is increasing . two possible reasons \n may explain that phenomenon : first , complement activation might be insufficient for an effective antifungal defence in risk patients ( due to , e.g. , low complement levels , poor recognition of fungal surface , or missing interplay with other immune elements in immunocompromised patients ) . \n on the other hand , fungi may have developed evasion strategies to avoid recognition and/or eradication by complement . \n in this review , we summarize the most important interactions between aspergillus and the complement system . \n we describe the various ways of complement activation by aspergillus and the antifungal effects of the system , and also show proven and probable mechanisms of aspergillus for complement evasion .

{"article": "activation of mast cell degranulation has been demonstrated to be an important mediator of allergic disease and more recently , as an initiator or contributor to autoimmune disease [ 1 -

terminal domain made up of anti - parallel three - helix bundles [ 8 , 10 ] .\nthe synaptosome - associated protein ( snap ) family of snares is an example of the qbc subtype and contain two snare motifs joined by a flexible linker and that is palmitoylated and therefore lacks a transmembrane domain [ 8 , 10 ] .\nthe snap family is unique in that they contribute two snare motifs to the snare complex .\nsoluble n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptors were previously classified based on whether they localized to the vesicle membrane ( v - snares ; e.g. vamps ) or to the target plasma membrane ( t - snares ; e.g. syntaxins and the snap families ) but these classifications have subsequently been shown to have a number of exceptions .\nsoluble n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptors localized on opposing membranes [ vesicle : vesicle or vesicle : plasma membrane ] drive fusion of membranes using the free energy released during the formation of the stable four - helix bundle .\npost - fusion snare proteins end up on the interior surface of the target membrane .\nthese bundles are recycled via dissociation mediated by n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor ( nsf ) and other co - factors such as snap ( soluble nsf attachment protein ) .\nmechanical models [ 6 - 11 ] all predict that snares function to bring opposing membranes into close proximity initiating fusion events .\nthe presence of ca is indispensable , acting to bridge the opposing membranes , which leads to the exclusion of water allowing lipid mixing , fusion and subsequent exocytosis .\nca - regulated snare complexes are involved in neurotransmitter release [ 8 , 23 ] .\nthe neuronal snare complex was the first snare complex identified and the most vigorously dissected .\ndocked vesicles containing snare complexes composed of syntaxin 1a and snap-25 on the plasma membrane and vamp-2 on the vesicular membrane allow for the rapid ( millisecond ) release of neurotransmitters upon ca influx .\nfree , uncomplexed membrane snares form cis - snare acceptor complexes on the plasma membrane in response to the actions of regulatory proteins .\nthese acceptor complexes on the plasma membranes interact with snares on opposing vesicular membranes and form trans - snare complexes that are fusion \nready. these  docked vesicles persist for a substantial period of time until ca influx triggers the final step of fusion and cargo ( neurotransmitter ) release through the actions of ca sensors such as synaptotagmin and complexins .\nvarious investigators have reported the expression of multiple snares in murine and human mast cells [ 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 1922 , 2431 ] .\ncomposite rt - pcr data identifying snare mrna in murine and human mast cells are presented in table 1 .\nthe neuronal snare snap-25 showed weak mrna expression in human mast cells , but was not detected via western blot in the same study .\nmultiple studies report the expression of several vamp family representatives mrna [ vamp-1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 ( r snares ) ] and several members of the syntaxin family [ syntaxin 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( qa snares ) ] as well .\nsnare family mrna expression in murine and human mast cells immunoblotting studies confirm that snap-23 is the consensus representative of the qb , c family in both murine and human mast cells ( see composite of protein expression data presented in table 2 ) .\ninterestingly , two groups have reported the expression of the neuronal snap-25 qb , c snare protein in primary murine mast cells via immunoblot and immunohistochemistry [ 25 , 27 ] .\nthese data could not be recapitulated in published work by several groups in primary murine mast cells [ 12 , 22 ] and the rat cell line rbl-2h3 [ 13 , 22 , 24 ] . the reason[s ] behind this discrepancy is not clear , but may involve specificity of antibodies and/or limits of detection of signal .\nprotein expression of vamp and syntaxin family members correlate well with mrna studies , as the majority of snares detected via rt - pcr were also detected via immunoblot .\nsnare family protein expression ( via immunoblotting ) in murine and human mast cells immunohistochemistry studies in primary murine mast cells [ 12 , 18 , 21 ] have demonstrated that snap-23 and syntaxin 4 localize to the plasma membrane , while syntaxin 3 , vamp-2 and vamp-8 appear to localize to secretory granules .\ndetected snap-25 expression in the secretory granules of rat primary mast cells ( rpmc ) .\nsimilar immunohistochemistry results in rbl-2h3 cells [ 13 , 14 , 24 , 29 , 31 ] have been reported demonstrating plasma membrane localization of snap-23 , syntaxin 4 and syntaxin 3 ; and secretory granule localization of syntaxin 3 , vamp-2 , 3 , 7 and 8 . in human mast cells ,\nsander et al .   demonstrated that snap-23 and syntaxin 4 localize in the plasma membrane while vamp-3 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm , suggesting granule localization .\nhowever , upon activation of the mast cell , only vamp-7 and vamp-8 appear to redistribute to the periphery of the cell , suggesting fusion and degranulation .\nimmunoprecipitation ( ip ) pull - down studies in primary murine mast cells , rbl-2h3 cells , and human mast cells have identified snare complexes composed of snap-23 and syntaxin 4 in complex with the r - snares , vamp-2 [ 13 , 18 , 28 , 29 ] , vamp-8 [ 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 22 ] ; vamp-7   and vamp-3 .\nin addition , complexes composed of snap-23 , syntaxin 3 and vamp-8 also co - precipitated .\n.   demonstrated that ip with anti - snap-23 antibody in rbl-2h3 cells pulled down syntaxin 2 , 3 , 4 and vamp-2 , 3 , 8 .\ninterestingly , n - ethylmaleimide ( nem ) treatment was required to observe vamp-8 co - precipitation .\nit was also demonstrated that ip with anti - syntaxin 4 resulted in the co - precipitation of snap-23 , vamp-2 , vamp-3 and vamp-8 , while ip with anti - syntaxin 2 or syntaxin 3 only pulled down snap-23 .\nthese data suggest that ternary complexes in rbl-2h3 cells consist of snap-23 , syntaxin 4 and a member of the r - snares family , presumably vamp-2 , 3 or 8 .\nshowed that in rbl-2h3 cell lysates ; syntaxin 4 co - precipitated with snap-23 and vamp-8 within and outside of lipid rafts ; however , syntaxin 3 , snap-23 and vamp-8 co - precipitates were found to be complexed only within lipid rafts .\nthe implication of these two different complexes and their unequal distribution in the membrane remains unclear .\nadditional studies by hepp et al .   demonstrated co - precipitated complexes of snap-23 , vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 in rbl-2h3 cells and also showed that most of the snap-23 associated with vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 in these complexes is phosphorylated .\nan elegant study by puri et al .   demonstrated that snap-23 , syntaxin 4 , vamp-2 complexes are present in lipid rafts and showed that snap-23 functions to recruit non - lipid raft - associated syntaxin 4 into a functional complex .\nonce again it was demonstrated that a predominant proportion of the snap-23 in complexes was phosphorylated , implicating snap-23 phosphorylation as a key prerequisite to complex formation .\nour group has demonstrated that in rbl-2h3 cells , snap-23 co - precipitates with syntaxin 4 and vamp-8 ; however , nem treatment was needed to observe vamp-8 association . in human mast cells isolated from surgical tissues , sander et al\n.   demonstrated that snap-23 co - precipitated with syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 , but not vamp-2 and vamp-3 . in\nderived mast cells , vamp-8 was shown to associate preferentially with syntaxin 4 and snap-23 , and to a lesser degree , vamp-2 .\nhowever , it appears that vamp-2 and vamp-3   may act to substitute for vamp-8 in vamp-8-deficient cells , perhaps due to an unusual compensatory mechanism .\nisolation of ternary complexes of snare proteins after cellular activation has proven anything but trivial .\nprevious data have demonstrated that only 5% of the snap-23 present in rbl-2h3 cells is actually capable of forming a complex after activation .\nfurthermore , it is suggested that snare complexes have limited lifespans after activation - induced formation [ 35 , 36 ] . using recombinant snare proteins , foster et al .  \ndemonstrated the in vitro association of the recombinant snares , snap-23 , vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 and further demonstrated that deletion of the amino terminus and the second coiled - coil domain of snap-23 inhibited binding to both vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 .\nalthough immunolocalization and ip studies identify the individual snare proteins and their complexes associated with mast cell function , functional studies aimed at disrupting snare complex formation / action provide a practical method to dissect the role of these complexes in mast cell degranulation .\nsnare proteins also function to mediate constitutive trafficking events through both endocytic and secretory pathways ; reviewed in hong et al .\npreviously published functional data have implicated the snares snap-23 , syntaxin 4 , vamp-2 , vamp-3 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 in mast cell degranulation in studies using streptolysin - o - permeabilized cells and inhibitory recombinant snare proteins , snare neutralizing antibodies [ 12 , 17 , 19 ] ; overexpression studies [ 13 , 14 , 22 , 29 , 38 ] , rna interference methods [ 20 , 22 , 39 ] and snare - deficient mice [ 18 , 21 ] .\na compilation of functional data implicating the various snare proteins is presented in table 3 .\nfunctional data implicating snare proteins in mast cell degranulation the most compelling evidence for the role of snare proteins in mast cell degranulation is presented in data describing vamp-8-deficient mice [ 18 , 21 ] .\n.   demonstrated that mast cells derived from the bone marrow of these mice [ bmmc ] had a 50% decrease in their ability to release -hexosaminidase and serotonin but had normal histamine and tnf- release .\ntiwari et al .   showed that bmmc from vamp-8-deficient mice resulted in a 50% decrease in -hexosaminidase and histamine , but no changes in cytokine / chemokine release .\nour group has shown via sirna that we could demonstrate about a 50% knockdown in rbl-2h3 degranulation after targeting vamp-8 mrna / protein .\ninterestingly , puri et al .   also showed that vamp-2 and vamp-3 do not play a role in mast cell degranulation as bmmc derived from vamp-3-deficient animals and mast cells derived from vamp-2-deficient stem cells showed normal degranulation .\nthese data are confirmed by studies with tetanus toxins [ 17 , 40 ] , which are known to cleave and inactivate vamp-2 but do not have any effect on mast cell degranulation . supporting evidence for the role of vamp-8 in mast cell degranulation comes from sander et al . , who demonstrated that neutralizing anti - vamp-8 antibodies inhibit degranulation in streptolysin - permeabilized human mast cells by 60% .\ndata from this report also demonstrated a role for vamp-7 ( 50% inhibition ) but not vamp-2 and vamp-3 .\nsimilarly , lippert et al .   demonstrated that recombinant vamp-8 inhibited ca-/gtps - mediated degranulation in permeabilized rbl-2h3 cells by 30% .\nour group 's sirna studies also implicate snap-23 and syntaxin 4 as essential for rbl-2h3 degranulation , as knockdown of these snares resulted in 30% inhibition of degranulation when compared to control sirna treatment . in support of our data ,\nsalinas et al .   demonstrated that in permeabilized rpmc , neutralizing antibodies to snap-23 and syntaxin 4 resulted in 25% and 65% inhibition of histamine release .\nin addition , sander et al .   demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies to snap-23 and syntaxin 4 inhibited histamine release from permeabilized human mast cells with inhibition reaching 90% and 40% , respectively .\nearlier studies by guo et al .   demonstrated that anti - snap-23 neutralizing antibody decreased rpmc degranulation , although this inhibition required high antibody concentrations ( 500 g / ml ) .\nrecently , suzuki et al .   demonstrated that a shrna to snap-23 knocked down degranulation in stimulated rbl-2h3 cells by 30% , similar to the maximal inhibition we have observed for snap-23 . in addition , liu et al .   demonstrated that treatment of rbl-2h3 cells with syntaxin 4 sirna resulted in a decrease in antigen - induced histamine and -hexosaminidase release .\ninterestingly , various groups [ 13 , 14 , 29 , 37 ] have implicated syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and snap-23 in mast cell degranulation via overexpression studies .\noverexpression of syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and snap-23 all had an effect on degranulation in rbl-2h3 cells , although the effects were manifested as either an augmentation or inhibition of degranulation .\nthe exact mechanism leading to augmentation or inhibition has yet to be elucidated but may involve competition for free snare proteins or competition for regulatory proteins . because many of the snare - deficient transgenic mice are embryonic lethal ( table 4 ) , sirna methods may represent the only efficient way to characterize degranulation pathways in both in vitro and in vivo models of anaphylaxis and autoimmune disease .\nmast cell phenotype of snare knockout animals / cells these reports provide evidence that these snares do not participate in the mast cell degranulation process .\nthere are a number of studies published recently that utilize sirna to validate the role of individual snares or snare complexes mediating trafficking events in various cell types [ 46 - 54 ] .\nhowever , an interesting report published recently   eloquently suggests that the abundance of snare - member isoforms and therefore the overall increase in snare redundancy may play a major role in the lack of snare sirna cellular efficacy .\nin addition , the authors describe the phenomenon that many cell types appear to express a sizeable reserve of snare proteins not required for normal physiological cellular processes ( a so - called  snare reserve ) .\ninterestingly , the literature is scant with respect to sirna studies characterizing snare - protein function in mast cells .\nin addition , as snares are intracellular targets , the use of biotherapeutics such as recombinant proteins or neutralizing antibodies is not possible as these large proteins can not as of yet be targeted to the inside of the cell . therefore , interfering rna offers an exciting new approach for the development of a snare - directed therapy . to date , several sirna - based therapies have initiated clinical trials for the treatment of viral diseases , cancer and macular degeneration .\nin addition , our sirna data identifies snap-23 and syntaxin 4 as essential for rbl-2h3 degranulation , and knockdown of these snares resulted in 30% inhibition of degranulation when compared to control sirna treatment .\nthese studies reflect the effect that a snare sirna therapeutic could have as we utilized whole cells stimulated with physiologic stimuli .\nhowever , additional studies focused on in vivo delivery of these sirna and testing in animal models of disease are warranted .\nsec1/munc18 ( sm ) proteins are arch - shaped cytosolic proteins that have been demonstrated to bind syntaxins and regulate intracellular trafficking [ 57 , 58 ] .\nspecifically , munc182 has been demonstrated to play a role in mast cell degranulation [ 15 , 26 , 31 ] .\nsm proteins appear to regulate snare activity in several ways [ 57 - 60 ] .\nthey can bind non - complexed syntaxins and act as negative regulators of snare assembly and interestingly , can also bind to trans - complexes and promote fusion .\nmembers of the munc13 family of accessory proteins also have been demonstrated to act as positive regulators of mast cell degranulation .\ncomplexins are cytosolic snare regulatory proteins that bind snare complexes and  lock the snare machinery into a primed state awaiting a final trigger of fusion events [ 57 , 60 ] .\nspecifically , complexin ii has been demonstrated to function as a positive regulator of mast cell degranulation as sirna to complexin ii attenuates ige - induced degranulation .\nsynaptotagmins are type i membrane calcium binding proteins that facilitate the formation of the snare  calcium\n phospholipid complex that triggers final fusion and release of mediators from the cell [ 57 , 60 ] . in mast cells ,\nthe rab family of gtpases has been implicated in the control of degranulation in mast cells .\nsecretory carrier membrane proteins ( scamps ) are accessory proteins that play a role in the regulation of mast cell degranulation .\nscamp-1 and scamp-2 are postulated to function at the later stages of membrane fusion , in concert with phospholipase d , to form functional fusion pores . finally ,\nas previously mentioned vide supra , snare disassembly is mediated by the proteins snap and the atpase nsf [ 60 , 64 ] .\nsnap functions to capture the snare complex and allow the binding of nsf and the subsequent disassembly of the snare complex .\nthe important qb , c and qa snares on the plasma membrane unequivocally appear to be snap-23 and syntaxin 4 , while the most likely r - snare partners on the vesicle membranes appear to be both vamp-7 and vamp-8 ( fig .\n1 ) . functionally , there is growing evidence that ternary complexes of the above snares are critically involved in the mast cell degranulation process .\ndisruption of these complex 's formation or interactions with regulators may offer a window for therapeutic intervention and the development of novel small molecules for the treatment of allergic and autoimmune disease .\nmodel of the mast cell snare complex mediating degranulation based on functional findings [ 1214 , 1622 , 29 , 3738 ] .\n( a ) snap-23 and syntaxin 4 represent the consensus plasma membrane snares involved in mast cell degranulation . under normal physiological conditions , vamp-7 and/or vamp-8 represent the secretory granule ( vesicle ) snare that interacts with snap-23 and syntaxin 4 to form a functional ternary complex .\n( b ) in the absence of vamp-8 , it appears that a compensatory mechanism may allow vamp-2 and/or vamp-3 to associate with snap-23 and syntaxin 4 to mediate ternary complex formation and possible function .", "human": " mast cell function and dysregulation is important in the development and progression of allergic and autoimmune disease . \n identifying novel proteins involved in mast cell function and disease progression is the first step in the design of new therapeutic strategies . \n soluble n -

patient , in - patient and community settings .\nwe analyzed a total of a total of 169 subjects seeking disability certification over the study period of 5 years was diagnosed with schizophrenia .\nschizophrenia remains the most common diagnosis among previous indian studies on disability among treatment seeking psychiatric patients .\nreported 65.3% of the subjects to be diagnosed with schizophrenia in their total sample of 285 over a 3 year period .\nhowever , affective disorders have been found to be the most common cause of disability among not treatment seeking individuals in community based studies . in spite of comparatively lower prevalence than other mental disorders schizophrenia continues to be over represented among treatment seekers in hospitals . in the current study ,\nan overwhelming majority of study subjects were male . in a community based epidemiological survey for disability in rural karnataka ,\nfemales constituted 68% of individuals with mental disability . in a recent study from karnataka , females constituted 49.1% of all disability certificate seeking individuals over a 3 year period .\nsimilarly , in a study among long stay patients diagnosed with schizophrenia 67.86% were male . in another study from assam ,\n31.6% of the study subjects were female . while previous indian studies have reported relatively later help seeking for female patients suffering from schizophrenia , the same is not reflected in the findings of the current study .\nin the present study male and female subjects did not differ significantly with regards to age at presentation , total duration of illness and duration since seeing treatment .\nthe study by kujur et al . also observed a significant difference in marital status of male and female patients with schizophrenia with majority ( 57.7% ) of women were separated from their husbands . a significantly higher proportion of female subjects were divorced or separated in the current study .\nprevious studies from the west have documented moderate disability in most of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia irrespective of the setting . in the current study\nindian studies have revealed the disability among patients with schizophrenia to moderate to severe as early as 2 - 5 years after illness onset . in a study from assam ,\n64% of patients suffering from schizophrenia and 30% of those suffering from bipolar affective disorder had severe disability as per the ideas .\nhowever , an indian study among non - treatment seeking individuals in a community setting found mild disability as the most common . in the present study , the highest disability for both male and female subjects was observed in the work domain of ideas .\nprevious indian studies have also reported occupational disability as the most disabling of all the categories . additionally , the least disability observed for personal care ( for both male and female subjects ) was also in keeping with similar observations in previous studies .\nhowever , another indian study conducted in a mental hospital setting found the highest level of disability for understanding and communication domain of world health organisation disability assessment schedule ii ( whodas ii ) .\ndisability in schizophrenia has been found to be affected by characteristics like age of onset and duration of illness among other factors . in a previous indian study from ranchi\nit was found that duration of illness has a significant correlation with personal areas of disability and age of onset has significant positive correlation with personal and occupational area of disability .\nhowever , in the current study a significant positive correlation between total duration of illness and global ideas score was observed only for the male subjects .\na previous study by thara et al . found a significantly higher global disability and occupational disability among male patients suffering from schizophrenia as compared to the female patients .\nhowever , the two did not differ for disability on other domains including self - care , social withdrawal and social contact . in the present\nalso the male and female subjects differed significantly only on the work domain of ideas .\nno significant differences were observed for personal care , interpersonal interaction and understanding and communication domains .\nalso , there was no significant difference on the global ideas score for male and female subjects .\nstigma , poor knowledge about the ideas , fear of misuse of certificates , discomfort to approach government hospitals , time constraints , rigid negative thinking about legal issues , denial of disability have been specified as some of reasons for underutilization of disability certification .\nlack of education among disabled is an important barrier for effective delivery of services . according to national sample survey organization , 2002\ngender has been found to be an important determinant of help seeking for mental disorders .\nwomen with common mental disorders were more likely to have sought some form of help than men in studies from western setting .\nhowever , the situation is different in developing countries such as india . due to socio - cultural factors women\nresearchers has revealed that those closest to the individual play an influential role in whether or not an individual seeks mental health services when experiencing distressing symptoms .\nmulti - ethnic studies have reported that asian patients with psychiatric illness tend to show the longest delay in help seeking .\nmore intensive , extended and persistent family involvement is a possible reason for the delay in seeking help by these individuals .\nthe present study offers some interesting and important insights in to disability certification seeking behavior of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia .\nthere is a relatively long gap between the onset of illness and disability certification . in spite of regulatory threshold of 2 years ,\nalso , all the female subjects in the present study were not gainfully employed and were financially dependent on the family . also , a significant greater proportion of them were either divorced or separated .\nthe findings also suggest a relatively early stabilisation of disability among females as the duration of illness was not found to be correlated with global ideas score .\nhowever , there was a significant correlation between these two variables for male subjects . relatively later impact of disorder on employment status is a likely possible reason for this observation .\nlack of impact of presence of psychiatric illness in another family member does not impact the disability seeking behavior of the study subjects .\nthis is a worrisome finding and it reflects poor education of family with regard to the provisions of disability certification and disability benefits available .\nthere is a need to disseminate information related to impact on disabled , community mobilization , opportunity for education , opportunity for work , transfer skills to community level , program activities , and involvement of disabled people .\nalso , research with respect to services , fund allocation , cost - effectiveness , manpower , training , and technical aid of disabled people should be strengthened .\na special emphasis should be placed on providing rehabilitation services and disability benefits to the unreached persons with disabilities living in rural areas and small towns of the country .\npositive impact of disability assessment camps on disability certification seeking behavior has been documented in india .\neven those who have received disability certification do not utilize the disability benefits offered by the government .\nthe underutilization is even more prominent in rural areas with disability pension being the most utilized benefit .\nwe included all the subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia seeking disability certification over the study period .\nassessment was carried out using a standardized indian instrument that has been used previously in indian settings . however , there are certain limitations as well .\nalso , the findings need to be replicated in multisite studies before they could be generalized .\nalso , it would be informative to review these subjects over time to assess the stability of disability level .\nadditionally , information on the utilization of disability benefits subsequent to certification should also be assessed in future studies .\nwe included all the subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia seeking disability certification over the study period .\nassessment was carried out using a standardized indian instrument that has been used previously in indian settings .\nalso , the findings need to be replicated in multisite studies before they could be generalized .\nalso , it would be informative to review these subjects over time to assess the stability of disability level .\nadditionally , information on the utilization of disability benefits subsequent to certification should also be assessed in future studies .\nmajority of patients with schizophrenia seeking disability certificate continue to be male . however , male and female subjects tend to differ very little on various socio -

{"article": "glutamate functions as the major excitatory neurotransmitter by binding to n - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( nmdars ) that are widespread in the central nervous system .\nthe nmdars constitute a major class of ionotropic glutamate receptors and play an essential role in synaptic transmission , plasticity , and memory .\nactivation of nmdars results in cell membrane depolarization with an equilibrium potential near 0 mv , producing the excitatory postsynaptic potential ( epsp ) and leading to an increase of ca influx into the cell .\nthe intracellular ca can in turn function as a second messenger , mediating a variety of signaling cascades .\nexcessive activation of nmdars by glutamate mediates neuronal damage in many neurological disorders including ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases ( choi et al .\nthe nmdars have long been considered the main target for the treatment of excitotoxicity - related neuronal injury , and a variety of antagonists or blockers of nmdars have been developed .\nunfortunately , the results of clinical trials have been disappointing because of the obvious side effects associated with blocking the physiological roles of nmdars ( chen and lipton , 2006 ) .\ntherefore , a better understanding of the mechanism of how nmdars can be modulated by regulatory proteins should help in the development of new therapeutic agents to counteract overactive nmda receptor function , and may represent an alternative to treating nmdar - mediated excitotoxic injury .\nthis short review focuses on the specific negative modulation of nmdars by a neuronal calcium sensor ( ncs ) protein , dream / calsenilin / kchip3 .\nnmdars are believed to be heterotetrameric complexes composed of combinations of the obligatory nr1 subunit and nr2 and/or nr3 subunits ( chazot and stephenson , 1997 ; laube et al .\n, 1998 ; schorge and colquhoun , 2003 ; furukawa et al . , 2005 ) .\nthe nr1 subunit is encoded by a single gene but exists as eight functional splice variants , while the nr2 ( nr2a - b ) and nr3 ( nr3a - b ) subunits are encoded by four and two different genes , respectively .\nthe nmdar subunits form a central ion conductance pathway selective for cations such as na , k , and ca , and share a common membrane topology , with each subunit consisting of four transmembrane ( tm ) domains ( m1m4 ) .\nthe long extracellular n - terminal regions of nmdar subunits are organized as a tandem of two domains .\nthe first domain , called the n - terminal domain ( ntd ) that includes the first 380 amino acids , is involved in tetrameric assembly ( mayer , 2006 ; paoletti and neyton , 2007 ; stroebel et al . ,\nthe second domain of about 300 amino acids is known as the agonist - binding domain ( abd ) that precedes the tm1 domain .\nthe abd binds glycine ( or d - serine ) in the nr1 and nr3 subunits , whereas the nr2 abd binds glutamate ( furukawa et al .\n, 2005 ; yao and mayer , 2006 ) . the pore loop ( p loop ) , or the m2 region , forms the narrowest constriction of the channel ion conductance pathway and determines the permeation properties of nmdars .\nthe nmdars feature an intracellular c - terminal tail of about 400600 residues that has a strong diversity in its amino acid sequence .\nthe c - terminal tails of nmdar subunits contain a series of short motifs that interact with intracellular factors or binding partners involved in receptor trafficking , anchoring and signaling ( skeberdis et al .\nactivation of nmdars requires a simultaneous binding of two co - agonists , glutamate , and glycine with different biophysical properties of ion permeation .\nthe typical nmdars contain nr2 subunits with properties of high permeability to ca and extracellular mg block at hyperpolarized membrane potentials ( wrighton et al .\ndifferent from conventional nr1/nr2 heterotetramers , nr3-containing nmdars have unique properties with a five to tenfold decrease of ca permeability , insensitivity to mg block , and reduced single - channel conductance and open probability , functioning as a negative modulator for nmda receptor channel function ( das et al . , 1998 ;\n2009 ; cavara et al . , 2010 ; henson et al . , 2010 ) .\nnmda receptors are also regulated by other intracellular signals and proteins , including calcium , protein kinases , protein phosphatase calcineurin , and calcium - sensitive proteins such as calmodulin ( legendre et al . , 1993 ; vyklicky , 1993 ; lieberman and mody , 1994 ; tong et al . , 1995 ; ehlers et al . , 1996 ) .\ncalcium - dependent nmda receptor desensitization and inactivation provides a feedback mechanism capable of regulating subsequent ca entry into the postsynaptic cell through nmda channels ( figure 1 ) .\nschematic representation for inhibitory effect of dream / calsenilin / kchip3 on nmdars in a ca - sensitive manner . upon activation of nmdars by glutamate\nbinding , ca influx through nmdars increases the association between dream and nr1 subunits , resulting in reduced surface expression of nmdars , and subsequent inhibition of nmdars - mediated ca influx and excitotoxicity .\ndream functions as a ca - sensitive modulator for the negative feedback control of nmdar function .\nso far , a number of nr1 or nr2 subunit binding partners have been identified in the postsynaptic density .\nthe nr1 binding proteins include calmodulin ( cam ) ( ehlers et al . , 1996 ; akyol et al . , 2004\n) , ca / cam - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) ( leonard et al . , 2002 ) , -actinin ( wyszynski et al . , 1997 ; merrill et al . , 2007 ) ,\ntubulin ( van rossum et al . , 1999 ) , spectrin ( wechsler and teichberg , 1998 ) , neurofilament ( ehlers et al . ,\ncalmodulin binding to the nr1 subunit is ca dependent and occurs with homomeric nr1 complexes , heteromeric nr1/nr2 subunit complexes from expression systems , and nmda receptors from the brain .\ncalmodulin binding to nr1 causes a fourfold reduction in nmda channel open probability , mediating the negative modulation of nmdar function ( ehlers et al . , 1998 ) .\nthe downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator ( dream ) protein , first identified in the nucleus as a ca - regulated transcriptional repressor through its binding to dna at specific regulatory elements , contains four ca - binding ef - hand domains and belongs to the ncs family ( carrion et al . , 1999 ; burgoyne , 2007 ) .\ndream was named for its ability to block gene expression in its ca - free form via direct binding with the downstream regulatory element ( dre ) sequence in target genes such as preprodynorphin ( ppd ) , c - fos , hrk , na , and ca exchanger ncx3 ( carrion et al .\n, 1999 ; sanz et al . , 2001 ; gomez - villafuertes et al . ,\ndream was also named calsenilin or kv channel interacting protein 3 ( kchip3 ) ( buxbaum et al . , 1998 ; an et al . , 2000\n) , indicating that dream / calsenilin / kchip3 has multifunctional properties . in the nucleus\nthe dream protein functions as a dimer , whereas outside the nucleus kchip3 is a monomer and regulates the surface expression and gating kinetics of kv4 channels ( an et al . , 2000 ;\nkim and sheng , 2004 ; scannevin et al . , 2004 ; pioletti et al .\ndream / calsenilin / kchip3 is preferentially expressed in the central nervous system , as well as in non - neuronal tissues ( link et al .\ndream / calsenilin / kchip3 knock - out mice display a hypoalgesic phenotype , suggesting a critical role of dream / calsenilin / kchip3 in pain modulation ( cheng et al . ,\nin addition , emerging evidence reveals the role of dream / calsenilin / kchip3 in long - term potentiation ( ltp ) ( lilliehook et al . , 2003 ) and learning and memory ( alexander et al . , 2009 ; fontan - lozano et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting a possible connection between dream and nmda function .\nkchip13 were initially identified from a rat brain library in yeast two - hybrid ( yth ) screens using the cytoplasmic n - terminal domain ( amino acids 1180 ) of rat kv4.3 as a bait ( an et al . , 2000 ) .\nsimilarly , kchip4 from mouse and human was accidentally cloned using the c - terminal 43 amino acid residues of presenilin 2 ( ps2 , amino acids 406448 ) as a bait in the yth system ( morohashi et al . , 2002 ) .\nkchip4 , also known as calsenilin - like protein ( calp ) , binds to ps2 which is known to facilitate intramembranous -cleavage of -amyloid protein precursor ( app ) ( morohashi et al . , 2002 ) .\nkchip14 ( 216  256 amino acids ) can co - immunoprecipitate and co - localize with either kv4 from co - transfected cells or kv4 -subunits from tissues , and thus constitute integral components of native kv4 channel complexes ( wang , 2008 ) . kchip14\nall share a conserved carboxy - terminal core region that contains four ef - hand - like calcium binding motifs , but have a variable amino - terminal region that causes diverse modulation of kv4 trafficking and channel function ( an et al .\n, 2000 ; holmqvist et al . , 2002 ; scannevin et al . , 2004 ;\nfindings from co - immunoprecipitation experiments show that dream antibody can immunoprecipitate endogenous nr1 subunit and dream protein from rat hippocampal tissue ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .\nin the reciprocal co - ip studies in hek 293 cells expressing dream and nr1 - 1a ( nr1a ) proteins , nr1 antibody can also immunoprecipitate dream along with the nr1 subunit .\ngst pull - down assays reveal that the n - terminus of dream directly interacts with the nr1a c - terminus , and that the dream - nr1 interaction is sensitive to ca and depends on the ef hand domains of dream ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .\npsd-95 is a major scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density , tethering nmdars to signaling proteins , and is critical for nmda receptor function ( kim and sheng , 2004 ) .\nwu et al . generated a line of transgenic mice ( tgdream ) overexpressing a dominant active dream mutant , and compared nmda receptor - mediated epscs in tgdream and wild - type mice under conditions of various stimulation intensities ( wu et al .\nthey found that the amplitude of nmda receptor - mediated epscs in tgdream mice is significantly reduced compared to that in wild - type mice ( wu et al . , 2010 ) .\nin addition , ltd is significantly reduced in tgdream mice whereas ltp is not affected by dream , demonstrating that dream interacts with psd-95 , and that the interaction is negatively regulated by calcium ( wu et al . ,\n2010 ) . in xenopus oocytes expressing nr2b - containing nmdars alone or together with dream ,\ntwo - electrode voltage clamp recordings show that , in the absence of dream , the peak currents of nmda channels activated by glutamate ( plus glycine ) are suppressed by dream , and the current decrease is caused by a reduction in the density of nmdars at the cell surface ( figure 1 ; zhang et al . , 2010 ) .\nfontan - lozano et al . recently provided another piece of evidence that dream negatively regulates the function of nmda receptors ( fontan - lozano et al . , 2011 ) .\nby taking advantage of mice lacking the dream protein , they demonstrated that the facilitated learning induced by decreased expression of kv4.2 in dream mice requires the activation of nmda receptors containing the nr2b subunit ( fontan - lozano et al . , 2011 ) .\nthis study not only indicates the significance of the balance between kv4 channel function and nmdar activity , but also suggests the formation of a functional complex between dream / kv4.2/nmdars that regulates the synaptic efficacy mediating synaptic plasticity and learning .\nexcitotoxicity is caused by overactivation of nmda receptor function , and inhibition of nmdars can reverse the neuronal toxicity .\nthe data available so far support both the pro - apoptotic and anti - apoptotic roles of dream .\nin general , the pro - apoptotic role of dream closely correlates with its interaction with presenilins , the production of amyloid beta ( a ) and the modulation in ca signaling , whereas the anti - apoptotic role of dream is conferred by its transcriptional repressor activity on the apoptotic protein hrk .\njo et al . reported that hela cells transiently transfected with dream exhibit the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis and that expression of presenilin potentiates dream - induced apoptosis ( jo et al . , 2001 ) .\njo et al . also reported that dream expression increases in either human neuroblastoma sk - n - be2(c ) cells or rat neuroblastoma b103 cells after exposure to a , but no other apoptotic inducers such as staurosporine , thapsigargin , and calcium ionophore a23187 .\nthe pro - apoptotic role of dream is selectively induced during ab toxicity . because of the involvement of presenilins/-secretase in a formation and neuronal death , dream coordinates with presenilin activity to play a crucial role in these processes through binding with the c - terminus of presenilins ( jo et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) .\nstably expressed dream in h4 neuroglioma cells which showed no initiation of apoptosis in the absence of apoptosis triggers , and the apoptosis - associated caspase and calpain activities were not affected by dream ( lilliehook et al .\non the other hand , binding of the transcriptional repressor dream to the hrk gene avoids inappropriate hrk expression and apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitor cell lines ( sanz et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) .\nnevertheless , the precise function of dream in pro - apoptosis and anti - apoptosis remains to be explored . from our previous observations\n, we noticed that cell viability is affected by the amount of exogenous dream gene and the method of transfection .\nhowever , we could not observe any obvious morphological changes associated with cell death after the transfection of dream . to prove the cytoprotective role of dream , we utilized cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons with dream overexpression or sirna - mediated knockdown , and evaluated lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) leakage and propidium iodide ( pi ) uptake both in nmda and oxygen - glucose deprivation ( ogd ) -induced excitotoxic injury models ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .\nadministration of nmda markedly increases the number of pi - positive cells ( dead cells ) in nmdar - transfected cho cells , whereas co - expression of dream greatly reduces pi - positive cells ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .\nogd is commonly used in vitro to mimic ischemia - reperfusion insult to the brain , and ogd treatment induces a significant increase of ldh release ( dawson et al . , 1994 ) .\nwith over - expression of dream , however , ogd treatment induces a smaller increase in ldh release .\nthese results indicate that the over - expression of dream attenuates nmdar - mediated excitotoxicity ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) . we have previously tested the effect of dream sirna on nmda - induced current and excitotoxic injury in hippocampal neurons ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .\nknockdown of endogenous dream with sirna results in an increased amplitude of nmda current recorded by whole - cell patch - clamp assays .\nafter nmda exposure , pi - positive cells in the dream sirna group increase compared with control sirna , indicating the inhibitory effect of dream on nmdar - mediated current and excitotoxic injury ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .\nthe ncs protein dream / calsenilin / kchip3 acts as an auxiliary subunit and suppresses nmda receptor channel function .\nthis negative modulation of nmda receptor function by dream likely provides a feedback mechanism by which overactive nmda receptors are inhibited .\ntherefore , targeting regulatory proteins of nmdars may represent an alternative approach to treating nmdar - mediated excitotoxic damage and providing neuroprotection .\nthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .\nthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .", "human": " n -

and - stick representation \n of the monoolein ( 9.9 mag ) lipid . \n\ndouble bonded \n carbon atoms ( c9 and c10 ) in the hydrocarbon chain of 9.9 mag are \n highlighted .\nthe grouping of atoms in martini \n coarse - grained beads ( eth , gl1 , c1a , c2a , d3a , c4a , and c5a ) is highlighted \n by ellipsoids .\n( b , c ) comparison of the triply periodic minimal surface \n ( tpms ) of pn3 m symmetry calculated from the improved \n nodal approximation given in eqs 13 ( b ) , to a snapshot after 6 s - long coarse - grained \n md simulations of spontaneous self - assembly of 9.9 mag / water complex \n at 40% ( w / w ) water concentration and at 20 c temperature ( c ) . \n\nthe figure in c ( see also figures 2 and 3 ) shows the location of the c5a coarse - grained beads \n from the 9.9 mag lipid ( see a ) ; note the cubic phase structure .\nthe \n similarity evident in b and c underscores the close relation between \n the organization of the c5a beads ( representing the density of terminal \n methylene and methyl groups in 9.9 mag lipids ) and the tpms of the pn3 m cubic phase .\nthe rapid pace of new structural data acquisition using the features of the in meso method \n underscores the usefulness and success of the technology .\nthus , structural \n information obtained in this manner for several rhodopsin - like gpcrs \n ( reviewed in ref ( 6 ) ) and a gpcr - g protein complex , provided \n breakthrough insights about the structural basis for signal transduction \n through these 7-tm helical proteins .\nhowever , the present lack of \n a mechanistic understanding , at the molecular level , of the events \n that lead to in meso crystallization of membrane \n proteins , makes the success of the method somewhat enigmatic and results \n in the need for extensive trials to identify specific conditions , \n that is , the host and additive lipid , precipitant etc .\nsuch in meso trials begin with the target \n protein \n being reconstituted into the lcp , and a hypothetical descriptive mechanism \n based on the membrane curvature and hydrophobic mismatch has been \n proposed to address \n the crucial step during in meso crystallization  the \n preferential partitioning of proteins from the lcp to the lamellar \n phase . in the original trials ,\nthe lipid used to form the lcp was \n monoolein ( 9.9 mag , see figure 1a ) , however \n recent experiments have utilized shorter chain analogs of monoolein \n as well as mixtures of monoolein with cholesterol ( see refs ( 12 , 18,21)and citations \n therein ) .\nthe reconstituted proteins appear to be well - accommodated , \n functional , and mobile inside the lcp where they are believed to reside \n largely in a monomeric state .\nthe addition of a precipitant \n of suitable composition , which is \n the next step in the in meso trial , is proposed to \n result in local structural and compositional changes in the mesophase \n and likely in protein conformation as well , which alter the interactions between the \n proteins and the cubic phase lipid bilayer ; ultimately this drives \n the preferential partitioning of the proteins into the lamellar phase \n that presumably appears within the lcp .\nthe critical aspect of the nucleation and subsequent crystal growth \n process that is triggered in this manner , and ultimately determines \n the quality of the grown crystals , is that once they have diffused \n from the lcp to the lamellar phase the proteins form tight 3d oligomeric \n arrays .\nthe oligomerization of \n tm proteins in lipid bilayers has generally \n been suggested to involve the hydrophobic mismatch effects originating \n from the difference in the lengths of the hydrophobic core of the \n protein and the surrounding lipid hydrocarbon region .\nsuch mismatch effects have been shown from experiments to play a \n role not only in the spatial organization but also in the function \n of tm proteins , such as the gpcr rhodopsin .\nthe hydrophobic mismatch is considered to drive the membrane to \n deform in order to alleviate the energetically unfavorable hydrophilic / hydrophobic \n exposure this mismatch entails .\nwhen such membrane deformation can not \n achieve a complete hydrophobic adaptation , the  residual exposure  \n ( or  residual mismatch  ) to unfavorable interactions \n gives rise to an unfavorable contribution to the free energy of protein / membrane \n interaction .\nthe mitigation of this energy \n term through oligomerization has been suggested as an important mechanistic \n contribution to membrane - driven oligomerization of multihelical tm \n proteins , such as gpcrs , in lipid bilayers .\ntherefore , we investigated the potential role of differential hydrophobic \n exposure of such proteins in lipid bilayers of the cubic and lamellar \n phases as a possible determinant of the favorable outcome of in meso crystallization trials . here\nwe present the \n results of a molecular dynamics - based study \n of a gpcr reconstituted into an lcp environment that reveal differences \n in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic exposure of the gpcr to lipid \nthe quantitative results \n reflect the drive for differential oligomerization behavior of these \n proteins in the two lipid environments that essentially define the \n end points along the in meso crystallization pathway . \n with the ability to connect quantitatively the difference in gpcr \n oligomerization behavior in the two different media , to the curvature \n and mismatch alleviation capabilities of the two environments ,\nwe \n are able to predict lipid types that would enhance / diminish the difference \n in the residual exposure for a gpcr in the cubic and lamellar phases . given the recognized importance of protein \nmembrane interaction \n for the functional properties of gpcrs , molecular dynamics simulation \n studies using all - atom and coarse - grained representations have been carried out for the prototypical gpcr , \n rhodopsin , in lamellar membranes . to our knowledge\nthe present work \n is the first molecular dynamics - based study of a gpcr reconstituted \n into the lcp .\nthe results enable quantitative inferences about the \n energetically unfavorable hydrophobic  hydrophilic interactions \n that differentiate the behaviors of gpcrs in the two different lipid \n environments , lcp and lamellar membranes .\nwe attain these insights \n from comparative microsecond time - scale coarse - grained simulations \n with the martini force - field of rhodopsin in monoolein - based \n cubic and lamellar lipid bilayers . using our recently reported computational \n framework for quantifying residual mismatch energies from md trajectories\n, we evaluated the protein - dependent membrane \n deformations and their attendant energy cost , and identified specific \n tm regions and residues of rhodopsin that exhibit differential hydrophobic \n exposure in the lcp and lamellar bilayers .\nwe show that the bilayer \n of the lcp more efficiently shields the protein from unfavorable interactions , \n and that the reduced level of hydrophobic mismatch in the lcp is attributable \n to the specific , highly curved geometry of the cubic phase .\nbetter \n protection from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure of rhodopsin in the \n lcp phase is especially evident for residues in tm helix 1 ( tmh1 ) \n and tmh5 .\nlcp environment , the planar bilayer of the lamellar phase provides \n a more favorable setting for gpcr oligomerization as a prelude to \n nucleation and crystal growth .\nthus , our findings provide novel energy - based \n insights into driving elements of in meso crystallization \n mechanisms and lay the foundation for future quantitative exploration \n of rational approaches for the generation of structure - quality crystals \n of membrane proteins .\ncoarse - grained ( cg ) md simulations of the lipid \n cubic phases ( lcp ) with or without rhodopsin were done with the martini \n force field , grouping atoms into coarse - grained \n beads ( see figure 1a ) , and the gromacs 3.3.1 \n package as listed for the various molecular \n constructs in table 1 . as a host lipid for \n the lcp , we used monoolein ( 9.9 mag ) which consists of an 18 carbon \n fatty acid with a cis double bond between carbons \n 9 and 10 in ester linkage to the primary hydroxyl of glycerol ( figure 1a ) .\nsimulation times reported are effective \n times , taking into consideration typical for martini force - field based \n coarse - grained simulations factor of 4 .\nsimulations with protein were initiated \n from self - assembled lipid diamond cubic phase of 500 lipids by replicating \n the monoolein / water system 27 times ( 3 times in positive and negative x , y , z directions ) and inserting rhodopsin randomly into \n the expanded lcp phase . in the first phase of the study\n, we conducted extensive self - assembly \n simulations of randomly mixed cg 9.9 mag lipids and water molecules \n into a lipidic diamond cubic phase .\nas listed in table 1 and detailed in the results , the diamond lipid phase was \n successfully achieved in multiple simulations conducted at 20 c \n temperature and 40% ( w / w ) water weight percent .\nall the self - assembly \n simulations ( see table 1 ) were initiated from \n a random placement of 500 cg 9.9 mags ( a number that is within the \n experimentally determined range of 9.9 mag molecules in the unit cell \n of the diamond cubic phase ) , and a corresponding number ( determined \n by the desired percentage ) of cg water beads in a cubic box .\neach \n system was first equilibrated for a short period of time with the \n isotropic pressure coupling scheme and the lennard - jones ( lj ) parameters \n of all the atoms set to those of the beads representing water molecules \n in the martini force - field .\nthis setup , implemented as well in earlier \n cg self - assembly simulations of the lcp , allowed efficient adaptation of the volume of the simulation box \n to the number of cg molecules in the system , and ensured complete \n mixing of lipids and waters prior to self - assembly simulation . after this initial equilibration phase ,\nthe lj parameters for 9.9 \n mag lipids were reset to their proper values ( see details of force - field \n parametrization , below ) , and 6 s - long self - assembly md simulations \n were performed ( the simulation times reported throughout are effective \n times , taking into consideration the \n factor of 4 typical for martini force - field - based coarse - grained simulations ) , \n and using isotropic pressure coupling ( with 3.0 ps and 3e bar time constant and compressibility , respectively ) , \n and a 30 fs time step . to simulate rhodopsin in the diamond phase\n, we constructed the system \n by replicating 27 times ( along positive and negative x , y , \n z directions ) one of the cubic phase structures obtained \n from the self - assembly simulations conducted at 20 c and at \n 40% ( w / w ) water .\nthe diamond cubic phase in this enlarged construct \n remained stable in a microsecond - long cg md simulation ( data not shown ) . \n\na rhodopsin molecule was inserted at a random position in this large \n cubic phase ( at 122:1 9.9mag / rhodopsin molar ratio , corresponding \n to 4 mg / ml concentration , see figure s1 in the supporting information ) . after removing overlapping waters \n and 9.9 mag molecules and adding counterions for electroneutrality , \n a 4.8 s - long cg md simulation was carried out at 20 c . \n\nthe total number of cg beads in this large construct was 139  979 , \n which corresponds to 1  400  000 actual \n atoms .\nthe simulation utilized the isotropic pressure coupling \n scheme as above , and a 30 fs time step .\nrhodopsin \n was simulated in 9.9 mag lipid lamellar bilayers with the cg martini \n force - field .\nthe cg model of rhodopsin ( see below ) was inserted into \n a pre - equilibrated cg 9.9 mag lipid membrane containing 1772 lipids , \n and after solvation and ionization steps , a 3.2 s - long md simulation \n was carried out at 20 c temperature using a 40 fs integration \n time step and the semi - isotropic pressure coupling scheme .\nthe details of the martini cg \n force fields and the parametrization scheme employed for 9.9 mag lipid \n and rhodopsin can be found in the supporting methods section of supporting information .\nthe residual exposure energy is the energy \n cost of the hydrophobic mismatch that persists in the equilibrium \n state of the membrane - protein interaction , even after membrane remodeling \n around multi - tm proteins has taken place to reduce the hydrophobic \n mismatch .\nthis result \n of the anisotropy of the protein  membrane boundary when multi - tm \n proteins are inserted in the bilayer has been discussed in detail . for rhodopsin , the residual exposure of residues in the tm segments \n was quantified with the computational protocol described in ref ( 30 ) in both the lipid cubic \n and lamellar phases , using solvent accessible surface area ( sasa ) \n calculations with the naccess software and a probe radius of 1.4  .\nas described previously , sasa values \n were obtained either with the solute comprising the protein only ( saprot ) , or with the solute containing the protein and the hydrophobic \n core of the lipid bilayer ( samem)the latter being \n defined as the 9.9 mag bilayer region consisting of the gl1-c1a - c2a - d3a - c4a - c5a \n cg beads ( see above for the cg bead definition , depicted in figure 1a ) .\nthe residual exposure sares was then \n calculated as sares = saprot  samem for polar residues and as sares = samem for hydrophobic residues ( see ref ( 30 ) for details ) .\nthese accessible surface \n values were used to obtain the residual mismatch energy penalty gres associated with a particular residue as \n gres = ressares , where res = 0.028 kcal/(mol ) is a constant of proportionality related to the free energy \n of transfer of amino acids between aqueous and lipid environments . according to a well - accepted protocol , interfacial trp , arg , and\nlys residues were not penalized for residual \n mismatch due to their ability to adapt favorably to hydrophobic / hydrophilic \n interfaces . for a quantitative assessment of the spatial organization of the \n bicontinuous lipid / water structures assembled computationally , we \n utilized an analytical fit of the data obtained from the simulations . \n to obtain this fit we represented the location of the lipid bilayer \n midplane of the bicontinuous cubic phase by the triply periodic minimal \n surface ( tpms , surface with zero mean curvature):1where f(x , y , z ,  )\nis the improved nodal approximation given by:2with3 and x = x , y = y , z = z , and p , q , r = c , s ( c and s stand for cosine and sine , respectively ) .\nthe { h , k , l } in the above equations are the crystallographic miller \n indices , and  is a fitting parameter such that 1/ represents \n the linear size of the primitive unit cell .\nthis surface was shown \n to provide an accurate representation of the surface in the pn3 m symmetry group ( see , for example , ref ( 3 ) and citations therein ) . for each 9.9mag / water trajectory listed in table 1 , a fit to the analytical solution was performed on 20 separate \n frames spaced 350 ns apart . to this end\nwe extracted the coordinates \n { xi } of n c5a coarse - grained beads representing the location of \n the terminal methylene and methyl groups in the hydrocarbon tail of \n 9.9 mag lipids for each frame , and the fit was done by optimizing f(xi ,  ) = ci through \n a search for the translational and rotational transformations that \n minimized  = ( 1/n)i=1ci . the quality of the fit was assessed from \n the distribution of { ci } values obtained from the minimization procedure ; this distribution \n is centered around the theoretical mean , zero ( i.e. , the analytical \n solution of eq 1 ) .\nsuch a distribution was collected \n for each md trajectory by merging the { ci } coefficients obtained from fitting all 20 separate \n frames , and the quality was assessed as described above ( see distribution \n plots and captions in figure 4 and in figure \n s3 in the supporting information ) . to compare quantitatively the structural arrangement \n of the lcp bilayer near the protein , to that in the bulk cubic phase , \n we employed two complementary approaches . in the first , we obtained \n an analytical solution for the lipid bilayer midplane around the protein \n by fitting the simulation data ( coordinates of c5a beads ) to f(x , y , z ,  ) = ci , as described above in the tpms representation , \n except that for this purpose the { ci } coefficients were also considered as variable parameters \n that must be self - consistently minimized ( see above ) . in this manner\n, \n the extent of the deviation of the mean value of the { ci } distribution obtained from the solution \n for the pn3 m phase ( ci  0 , see above ) , \n measures the distortion of the diamond cubic phase due to the protein . the alternative approach we developed for quantifying the perturbation \n of lipid bilayer shape induced by the gpcr departs from the symmetry \n group definition and focuses on the lipid  water boundary . in \n this approach ,\ndifferent trajectory frames from the simulation of \n rhodopsin in lcp are aligned onto snapshots from the simulations of \n the large protein - depleted 9.9 mag / water system . using a locally defined \n scoring function ( see below ) , we assess how well the lipid bilayers \n of the protein - containing and protein - free systems align ( the large \n protein - free system was constructed by replicating 27 times the equilibrated \n system composed of 500 9.9 mag lipids/6800 water molecules , and subjecting \n it to microsecond long cg md simulation during which the pn3 m phase was maintained ; data not shown ) . to align the protein - free \n and protein - containing structures , we \n used water densities to first align 10 frames from the last 100 ns \n of the protein - free simulation , which served as a reference on which \n we aligned 10 frames from the last 100 ns of the protein - containing \n trajectory . only water beads at least 50  away from the protein \n were considered , in order to avoid degradation of the alignment quality \n due to deformations of the lipid cubic phase near the protein .\nthe alignments utilized the electron density (y ) at any point y of a set of beads with coordinates \n ri ; the density function was constructed \n as a superposition of gaussians , so that for a particular trajectory \n frame4where c and k are the amplitude and width of the gaussians , respectively , chosen \n to produce a 10  resolution density map .\nthe quality of the superposition of two frames was \n estimated by \n measuring the overlap of the water - containing and water - free regions \n using:5where x = { xj } ( j = 1,2, ... ,m1 , m1 + 1, ... ,n ) are coordinates of beads in \n the fitted frame which contains m1 water \n beads and n  m1 lipid beads ; w is the density \n of water in the reference frame obtained using eq 5 ; sj = 1 for j  m1 , and sj = 1 for j > m1 .\nthe best alignment was calculated by maximizing s with respect to the rotational and translational transformations \n applied to x. the local quality of the alignment \n was assessed by a normalized \n scoring function defined as:6where (xj ) represents the electron density of the \n beads in the reference frame .\nthe self - assembly of the 9.9 mag / water complex \n with 40% ( w / w ) water composition was probed at 20 c , which are \n conditions similar to those used in the original in meso crystallization trials of gpcr proteins ( see ref ( 14 ) and citations therein ) . \n figures 2 and 3 show several views of \n 9.9 mag / water complexes obtained under these conditions produced by \n the 6 s - long self - assembly simulation of 500 9.9 mag lipids . \n in figure 2 , panels a  c offer views \n of the unit simulation cell , whereas figure 3 depicts various snapshots of the same system replicated 27 times \n ( 3 times in each orthogonal direction ) .\ntypically , in our simulations \n the initially randomly mixed 9.9 mag / water system became organized \n as illustrated in figures 23 within the first 350 ns of simulation , and remained \n stable for the remainder of the 6 s trajectory .\n( a , b ) views of the unit \n simulation cell containing 9.9 mag / water \n complex at 40% ( w / w ) water concentration and at 20 c temperature , \n after 6 s of self - assembly simulation .\n( a ) entire system where \n different components are colored as following : 9.9 mag lipid headgroup \n beads , blue ; 9.9 mag lipid hydrocarbon tail beads , red ; and water \n beads , cyan .\n( b ) separately 9.9 mag hydrocarbon chain beads from the \n same perspective as in a. ( c ) view of the tetrahedral arrangement \n of the water channel from a. the four arms of the tetrahedral geometry \n are visible .\n( d ) snapshot of two nonintersecting continuous intertwined \n water channels ( in gold and cyan , respectively ) .\nthe representations \n are for the  expanded  system obtained by replicating \n the simulated system 9 times ( in positive x , y , and z directions ) .\nviews of the 9.9 mag / water complex from figure 2 replicated 27 times ( 3 times in positive and negative x , y , and z directions ) reveal bicontinuous \n diamond cubic phase nature of the self - assembled structure .\ndifferent \n panels show : the entire system ( a ) , 9.9 mag headgroup and water cg \n beads ( b ) , 9.9 mag hydrocarbon chain beads ( c ) , only water beads ( d ) . \n\nthe bicontinuous cubic phase nature of the self - assembled \n structure \n is apparent from inspection of the spatial organization of both lipid \n and water components .\nindeed , the hydrophobic core of the 9.9 mag \n lipids ( shown in red in figures 23 ) traces a single highly curved continuous surface \n in 3d , surrounded by 9.9 mag headgroups ( dark blue shades in figures 23 ) adjacent to aqueous \n compartments ( cyan colors in figures 2a , c and 3 ) .\nthe aqueous part of the system consists of two \n nonintersecting three - dimensional continuous networks of water channels \n ( figure 2d ) , which makes the assembled structure \n a bicontinuous cubic phase .\nfigure 2c \n shows that in each of the water \n compartments four aqueous channels meet in a tetrahedral arrangement . \n\na similar arrangement can be observed as well for the surface traced \n by the hydrocarbon chains of 9.9 mag lipids ( see figures 2b and 3c ) .\nthus , the assembled structure \n resembles closely the doubly bicontinuous lipidic diamond cubic phase . \n\none general feature of such mesophases is that the surface traced \n by the midplane of the lipid bilayer , which separates the two aqueous \n compartments , can be approximated by the triply periodic minimal surface \n ( tpms ) that has a special property : it is characterized at every point \n by zero mean curvature .\nconsequently , the tpms is saddle - shaped ( figure \n s2 , supporting information ) .\nthis saddle - shaped \n geometry of the 9.9 mag / water assembly resulting from our calculations \n can be appreciated , for example , by tracing the surface formed by \n the 9.9 mag hydrophobic core ( see figures 23 ) . for a quantitative assessment \n of the adherence of the bicontinuous \n structure from our simulations to the organization of the pn3 m diamond cubic phase\n, we performed a fit of the simulation \n data to the analytical solution , as described in methods .\nthe quality of the fit was assessed quantitatively \n from the distribution of the fitting coefficients { ci } ( see methods ) shown in figure 4 .\nclearly , the distribution is centered around zero mean , and is \n relatively narrow ( with a standard deviation of 0.4 ) , suggesting \n that the surface traced by the c5a beads is consistent with the tpms \n of the pn3 m cubic phase ( see eqs 13 ) .\ndistribution of { ci } coefficients from the fitting \n of the c5a bead positions from the \n simulations to the analytical tpms approximation ( see methods ) .\nthe  test established the significance of the fit \n with probability p < 0.05 .\nas indicated in table 1 , \n the self - assembly \n of 9.9 mag / water mixture was investigated in two additional simulations \n performed at t = 20 c and 40% ( w / w ) water content . \n in all cases 9.9\nmag and water molecules aggregated in doubly bicontinuous \n diamond lipid cubic phases , similar to that described in figures 23 ( see figure s3 \n in the supporting information ) . to explore the organization \n of a gpcr inside the cubic mesophase we simulated the prototypical \n class - a gpcr , rhodopsin , in 9.9 mag - containing lipidic cubic phase \n in a large system constructed as described in methods .\nthe simulation results were used as described below to compare \n quantitatively the interactions of rhodopsin with bilayers of the \n cubic and lamellar phases , as a basis for interpreting the mechanistic \n role of the hydrophobic mismatch in triggering the nucleation process \n during the in - meso crystallization .\nresidues in the rhodopsin tm bundle that participate \n in unfavorable interfacial hydrophobic / hydrophilic interactions with \n the lipid bilayers of the cubic and lamellar phase were identified , \n as described in methods , with a sasa - based \n approach .\nthe last 1.5 s intervals \n from the respective cg md trajectories for rhodopsin in the 9.9 mag \n lcp ( 4.8 s ) , and in the 9.9 mag lipid lamellar phase ( for 3.2 \n s ) were used for the residual exposure analysis ( see methods for definitions ) , and the corresponding \n residual exposure energies were evaluated as described .\ntable 2 lists rhodopsin \n tm residues that were found to exhibit different hydrophobic exposures \n in the lcp and lamellar phase simulations , alongside their respective \n residual exposure energy penalties ( gres ) .\nall other residues in the tm bundle experienced a residual \n penalty of < 1 kbt ( kb denoting the boltzmann constant ) in both lpc \n and lamellar phases .\nanalysis was carried out on the \n last 1.5 s time interval of the respective trajectories where \n sasa values and corresponding residual exposure energies remained , \n within fluctuations , unchanged .\nnumbering shown in parentheses corresponds \n to the generic residue numbering scheme for gpcrs defined by ballesteros \n and weinstein .\ndifferent residual exposure in the two lipid environments \n became \n evident for residues in the extracellular ( ec ) end of tmh1 , and the \n intracellular side ( ic ) of tmh5 ( table 2 ) . \n\nspecifically , the pro34/gln36 pair on \n tmh1 ( superscript numbers identify the residues by the ballesteros \n and weinstein generic residue numbering scheme for gpcrs ) , and phe228 in tmh5 were found \n to generate a lower residual exposure energy penalty in the lcp than \n in the lamellar phase .\nespecially remarkable is the difference in \n gres for the hydrophobic pro34 residue , that is , 4.7 kbt in the lamellar bilayers , but < 1 kbt in the cubic phase .\nthis difference \n results from pro34 being largely exposed to the lipid \n polar headgroups and/or water environment in the planar membrane , \n but shielded from such unfavorable interactions in the lcp .\nthe large residual exposure predicted for pro34 in \n the lamellar 9.9 mag bilayers is consistent with findings from our \n earlier all - atom md simulations of rhodopsin in planar membranes composed \n of dicn:1pc ( n = 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 ) lipids ; \n the largest residual exposure for pro34 was found in \n the bilayers with the thinnest hydrophobic core , that is , dic14:1pc and dic16:1pc membranes .\ndue to the substantial \n difference between the hydrophobic length of tmh1 in rhodopsin ( 37  , measured along \n the membrane normal ) \n and the bulk hydrophobic thickness of the thinner bilayers ( 27.2 \n and 30.5  , respectively for dic14:1pc and dic16:1pc membranes ) , the mismatch was \n not alleviated by membrane deformations around the protein ( see ref ( 30 ) ) . here\n, the hydrophobic \n thickness of the 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers , calculated from the average \n distance between the lipid gl1 backbone beads on the two leaflets , \n is 31.5  , so that the hydrophobic mismatch between tmh1 and \n the bilayer is again substantial , and can be alleviated only partially \n by membrane deformation , as shown below .\nthe average thickness \n of the 9.9 mag lamellar bilayer around rhodopsin , \n calculated from the last 1.5 s of the md trajectory and the \n membrane thinning around tmh2the helix adjacent to tmh1is \n evident in figure 5 .\ninterestingly , we find \n that the bilayer deforms near the polar ser98 residue \n ( see figure 5d ) , which is apparently shielded \n from the unfavorable exposure to the hydrophobic lipid core by the \n local thinning of the lipid membrane .\nusually , the membrane - facing \n oh of ser residues in a tm bundle can avoid hydrophobic contact \n by forming hydrogen bonds with the helix backbone .\nwhen this is not \n feasible energetically , the bilayer thins around this residue . in \n our simulations\nwe find that in order to shield ser98 from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure , the thinning at tmh2 also \n constrains the lipids at the adjacent tmh1 ( see ref ( 30 ) for a discussion of this \n type of constraint ) , so that the membrane can not deform significantly \n and thus leaves the pro34 residue highly exposed ( see \n figure 5d and table 2 ) .\n( a  c ) views of membrane deformation patterns around the \n rhodopsin immersed into 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers .\nthe average positioning \n of membrane leaflets is identified by the two surfaces colored according \n to the local thickness of the bilayer ( see the bar for color definition ) . \n\nthe gpcr is shown in van der waals representation with the tm helices \n colored as follows : tm1 in gray , tm2 in orange , tm3 in white , tm4 \n in pink , tm5 in purple , tm6 in black , and tm7 in lime the rest of \n the protein ( loops , etc . )\n( d ) magnified view of the \n region containing residues pro34 and ser98 ( both rendered in green ) showing the membrane deformations in their \n vicinity .\nfigure 5 shows that the \n 9.9 mag planar bilayer \n deforms around other tm helices as well .\nspecifically , the membrane \n thins around tmh4 , alleviating the residual mismatch for this helix , \n and around tmh7 where the deformation efficiently accommodates the \n juxtaposed amphipathic helix 8 at the hydrophobic / hydrophilic interface . \n\noverall , the heterogeneous pattern of membrane deformations we observe \n around rhodopsin in the current simulations agrees with earlier findings \n from all - atom md simulations showing the pattern of membrane remodeling \n around rhodopsin and the homologous serotonin 5-ht2a gpcr .\nconsistent with those studies , \n we find here that the deformations of the lamellar 9.9 mag bilayer \n do not completely alleviate the hydrophobic mismatch with the receptor \n ( table 2 ) .\nthe different organization of the \n two lipid phases around the gpcr , as presented below , explains why \n the residual exposure was larger for rhodopsin in the lamellar 9.9 \n mag bilayer than in the 9.9 mag lcp .\nfigure 6 shows the \n organization of the lipid cubic phase around rhodopsin in the initial \n configuration where the protein was randomly inserted in the lcp ( see \n also figure s1 in the supporting information ) , compared to the organization after 4.8 s of cg md simulations . \n\nc with d  f in figure 6 shows the substantial rearrangement of the lipids and solvent \n around rhodopsin during the long md trajectory .\nspecifically , it appears \n that the lcp tends to minimize hydrophobic / hydrophilic contacts with \n the gpcr as the water and lipid headgroup beads organize around polar \n regions of the protein ( yellow colors in figure 6 ) , whereas the lipid hydrocarbon chain beads surround the hydrophobic \n core of the protein ( see caption of figure 6 for tm definitions ) .\nsnapshots illustrating initial ( a  c ) , and final \n ( after 4.8 \n s simulations ) positioning ( d  f ) of rhodopsin ( in yellow / white ) \n inside the cubic phase .\na and d show the organization of water beads \n ( in cyan ) , b and e illustrate the organization of 9.9 mag lipid headgroup \n beads ( in pink ) , and c and f show the organization of 9.9 mag lipid \n hydrophobic core beads ( in purple ) . in all panels\nrhodopsin transmembrane \n ( tm ) helices are colored in white and the rest of the protein in yellow . \n\nshown are only water and 9.9 mag lipids that are within 20  \n of rhodopsin ; rhodopsin is oriented so that its intracellular and \n extracellular ends ( as defined in the lipid bilayer ) point toward \n the bottom and top of the panels , respectively .\nthe snapshots in figure 6 also show that \n rhodopsin equilibrates , as expected , around the saddle - point inside \n the lcp so that the tm bundle perpendicularly \n traverses a narrow but relatively flattened region of the lcp bilayer , \n much like the gpcr protein does in the lamellar bilayers .\nhowever , \n due to continuous and intrinsically saddle - shaped geometry of the \n diamond cubic phase , the lcp bilayer is dramatically curved near tmh1 \n and tmh5 , which effectively confines the protein to a small region \n of the lcp .\nthis special arrangement of the cubic mesophase around \n rhodopsin shields the gpcr in the lcp from the kind of unfavorable \n hydrophobic / hydrophilic interactions with the lipid bilayer seen in \n the lamellar membranes .\nthus , as illustrated in figure s4 ( in the supporting information ) and reflected in the \n residual energy penalties ( in table 2 ) , residues \n pro34 and phe228 are in contact with \n the hydrophobic core of the lcp bilayer and therefore do not incur \n a residual mismatch penalty , although gln36 experiences \n somewhat higher residual exposure in the lcp compared to the lamellar \n phase ( see figure s4 and table 2 ) .\nglamellar to be 2.7 kbt for the pro34/gln36 pair , and 1.8 kbt for phe228 ( table 2 ) .\nnotably , the shielding of ser98 that faced the 9.9 mag lipid bilayer in the lamellar phase \n simulations , occurs in the lcp simulations through interaction with \n the protein backbone . to relate the calculated residual mismatch \n energies to the organization \n of the lipidic cubic mesophase around the gpcr , we quantitatively \n\ncompared the structural arrangement of the lcp bilayer near the protein , \n to that in the bulk cubic phase . as described in methods ,\ntwo different approaches were used : in the first , \n we obtained an analytical fit of the lipid bilayer midplane shape \n around the protein by fitting the coordinates of 9.9 mag lipid c5a \n methyl terminus beads ( figure 1a ) from the \n simulations to f(x , y , z ,  ) = ci , considering \n { ci } coefficients as \n variable parameters that must be minimized during the fitting ( see methods ) .\nthe application of this procedure to spherical \n lipid shells situated at different distances from rhodopsin ( see figure 7a ) revealed that the organization of the lcp close \n to the gpcr is different from that expected for the pn3 m lipid bilayer ( ci  0 in figure 7a ) .\nhowever , \n already at distances 50  from the center of rhodopsin \n ( compare to 3540  linear dimension of a rhodopsin - like \n gpcr in bilayer x  y plane directions ) , the \n simulated structure relaxes to the organization of the diamond cubic \n phase ( ci \n = 0 , figure 7a ) .\nthe second approach confirms \n that the distorted lcp bilayer near the protein tends to relax toward \n the pn3 m phase arrangement at larger distances ( figure 7b ) . in this alternative approach\nwe locally quantify \n the shape of the lipid bilayer around the gpcr by aligning trajectory \n frames from the simulation of rhodopsin in lcp onto snapshots from \n the simulations of the pure lcp system , so as to optimize the overlap \n of the water - containing and water - free regions ( see methods ) . a scoring function defined locally ( see eq 5 ) is used to assess the quality of the alignment . \n\nas seen from figure 7b , this procedure revealed \n that the fit between the densities of c5a lipid beads in protein - containing \n and protein - free systems progressively improves with the radial distance \n from the gpcr ( increasing s in figure 7b ) .\nindeed , consistent with the result in figure 7a , the scoring function reaches its plateau 50  \n away from the protein , indicating that at these distances the lcp \n arrangement becomes similar to that expected for the pn3 m phase .\ndistance dependence of the relaxation of membrane deformation near \n rhodopsin in the cubic phase .\n( a ) analytical fit of the density of \n c5a 9.9 mag lipid beads from cg md simulation of rhodopsin in the \n lcp phase to the surface defined by the f(x , y , z ,  ) = ci equation ( see methods ) .\nthe mean values \n of the { ci } fitting coefficient \n distribution as a function of r , are shown for 10 \n  spherical lipid shells located at r = 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50  away the protein center - of - mass . \n\n( b ) reasults from the same measurements performed with an alternative \n approach based on the alignment of the lipid bilayer midplane in protein - containing \n and protein - free cubic phases ( see methods ) .\nthe quality of the fit upon alignment was determined for 10  \n spherical lipid shells located at distances r from \n the protein center - of - mass , and the panel shows the dependence of \n the scoring function s on r. note \n that the deformed cubic phase near rhodopsin relaxes to the arrangement \n that is characteristic of the pn3 m phase 50 \n  away from the protein .\ntaken together , our results establish a quantitative \n link between \n the residual mismatch penalty and the lipid bilayer deformations around \n the gpcr in the cubic phase .\nthus , the areas where the largest perturbations \n from the diamond cubic phase were observed included residues pro34 and phe228 ( see figure s5 in the supporting material ) , which are also the residues \n with the largest value of glcp  \n glamellar ( table 2 ) .\nthe main findings from this study offer \n unprecedented insight into \n molecular level processes related to in meso crystallization , \n which are likely leading to protein nucleation and eventually to crystal \n growth .\nthus , we found that the difference in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic \n exposure of the protein to the lipid bilayers of 9.9 mag lcp and lamellar \n phases is responsible for a lower residual mismatch ( and its corresponding \n energy penalty ) in the cubic mesophase compared to the lamellar membranes . \n\nthis indicates why gpcrs reconstituted into the lcp in the initial \n stages of the in meso trial are well accommodated \n inside the cubic phase , where they are believed to reside mostly in \n the monomeric form .\nindeed , from our findings there is insignificant \n drive toward rhodopsin oligomerization in the lcp .\nwe showed , however , \n why this drive is increased in the planar bilayer environment of the \n lamellar phase where there are several critical mechanistic factors \n that determine the probability for proteins to oligomerize .\none important \n energy component that has been established from both experiments and computations , involves the hydrophobic mismatch . \n\nin particular , a plausible mechanism to relieve the energy penalty \n due to residual exposure is protein oligomerization , whereby the tm \n segments incurring the highest energy penalty from the residual exposure \n come together in the lipid bilayer . for \n such hydrophobic - mismatch driven association to occur\n, the \n residual exposure penalty alleviated by the protein association must \n counteract other critical factors that could favor proteins in the \n monomeric state .\none such important consideration is the mobility \n of proteins , because constrained diffusion reduces the chance for \n protein  protein encounter . as shown in figure 8 , the spatial restriction encountered by the gpcr inside the \n lcp\n( see figure 6 ) significantly affects protein \n mobility , with the diffusion coefficient of the gpcr in the cubic \n phase being smaller ( dlcp = 1.1  \n 10 m / sec ) than that in the lamellar \n bilayers ( dlamellar = 5.5  10 m / sec ) .\nthe restricted diffusion mode \n for rhodopsin in the lcp environment is consistent with the suggested \n high energy cost in the lcp for gpcr - sized proteins to cross between \n different regions of the mesophase .\nthis \n energy penalty was quantified from phenomenological principles to \n be as high as 1220 kbt in the pn3 m phase with lattice parameter values in the 75110  \n range .\nthis estimated energy cost of protein \n diffusion in the lcp is significantly higher than the residual mismatch \n penalty we calculated for rhodopsin in the cubic phase ( table 2 ) . when considered together , the relatively low \n residual exposure energy for the gpcr in the lcp is not likely to \n be sufficient to compensate for the high energy barrier for protein \n mobility in the lcp and drive protein association .\nthe prediction \n is , therefore , that in the cubic mesophase gpcr proteins will remain \n largely in the monomeric state .\nmean - square - displacement ( msd ) as a function of \n time calculated for rhodopsin in the 9.9 mag lipidic cubic phase ( lcp ) \n and in the 9.9 mag lamellar membrane ( lamellar ) .\ncorresponding diffusion \n coefficient values , calculated from the linear fit performed in [ 0 \n s;1 s ] time interval , are dlcp = 1.1  10 m / sec and dlamellar = 5.5  10 m / sec .\nin contrast to the lcp , the lamellar membrane environment \n is more \n favorable for gpcr oligomerization : the residual energy penalty for \n the rhodopsin tm bundle in the lamellar bilayers is 8 kbt ( table 2 ) and is significantly higher compared to that in the lcp , \n indicating a stronger drive for gpcr oligomerization in the lamellar \n membranes .\na higher propensity for association in the planar bilayers \n is also supported by our calculations of the protein mobility in the \n two lipid environments , whereby we find a 5-fold larger diffusion \n coefficient for the gpcr in the lamellar bilayers ( figure 8) .\ntaken together , results from our simulations \n suggest that planar \n 9.9 mag lipid membranes provide a more suitable setting for oligomerization \n of the gpcr proteins .\nnotably , this prediction is based on results \n for oligomerization in a plane of the lipid bilayer .\nthis 2d nucleation \n process together with the formation of protein - enriched lamellar stacks \n in 3d should ultimately drive the emergence \n of a bulk crystal .\nthe question remains regarding the mechanism \n that drives the proteins \n from the lcp to the lamellar membranes and the potential role of the \n differential residual interactions between the protein and the bilayers \n of the two lipidic phases in the nucleation process .\nwe note that \n the nucleation is triggered by the addition of the precipitant which \n is known to cause transient water depletion from the lcp interior , resulting in structural changes in the cubic \n phase bilayer .\nour current study has not attempted to quantify the \n effects of the precipitant , but it is reasonable to speculate that \n dehydration of the cubic phase will only increase the unfavorable \n residual interactions between the gpcr and the lcp bilayer .\nthis is likely to increase the drive for protein \n oligomerization inside the lcp upon precipitant addition , which could \n lead to the formation of locally flattened lamellar bilayers as a \n prelude to protein crystallization . in order to address quantitatively \n the structural perturbations due to precipitant , such as changes in \n curvature of the lcp bilayer ,\nit is critical to calculate the corresponding \n deformation energies in the presence of the protein .\nhowever , the \n representation of the complex geometry of the lcp around the insertion \n ( figures 67 ) \n in the numerical approach developed in the current work for quantifying \n the lcp shape ( i.e. , fitting the md data to the analytical solution ) \n is not sufficiently refined to serve in the calculation of reliable \n energies\nwe note , however , that recent experimental studies showed that , compared to 9.9 \n mag , in meso trials conducted on the gpcr - gs protein \n complex with a shorter chain mag analog , 7.7 mag ( acyl chain 14 carbon \n atoms long with the cis double bond between carbon atoms 7 and 8) \n resulted in better quality crystals .\nthus , results from our \n current studies as well as from recently reported all - atom simulations \n of gpcrs in membranes of different thicknesses , explain why 7.7 mag would provide a better platform in \n which gpcrs can aggregate more extensively : based on our findings \n we can predict that , due to the expected 78  \n difference in the hydrophobic thickness of planar 9.9 mag and 7.7 \n mag membranes , the residual exposure of the gpcr will be substantially \n higher in the thinner 7.7 mag lamellar bilayers . as an example\n, we \n recently reported that the rhodopsin tm bundle will exhibit a 12 kbt higher residual energy penalty \n in dic14:1pc than in dic18:1pc bilayers .\na more complete quantitative elucidation of \n the gpcr nucleation process in relation to the residual mismatch energy \n component requires further studies that would take into consideration \n the effect of the different precipitants on various lipids .\nthe structurally specific predictions of the regions where the \n residual mismatch with lipid bilayers of cubic and lamellar phases \n differed for the rhodopsin tm bundle made it possible to probe the \n resulting predictions and general character of the findings by examining \n crystallographic data . in particular , we showed here that the intracellular \n ( ic ) end of tmh1 ( pro34 ) , and the extracellular ( ec ) \n part of the tmh5 including phe228 have higher residual \n exposure in lamellar membranes , which leads to the prediction ( e.g. , \n see shan et al . )\nthat in the planar bilayers \n rhodopsin will exhibit strong hydrophobic - mismatch driven tendency \n for oligomerization through tmh1 and tmh5 . to assess this hypothesis \n in the context of structural information available for gpcrs , we examined \n crystallographic contact interfaces for 12 different structures of \n rhodopsin - like gpcrs obtained by means of the in meso technology ( 2 receptor  pbd codes : 2rh1 , 3pds , 3sn6 ; a2a receptor  \n pdb codes : 3eml , 3qak ; chemokine \n cxcr4 receptor  pdb codes : 3odu , 3oe0 , 3oe6 , 3oe8 , 3oe9 ; dopamine d3 receptor \n  pdb code : 3pbl , and histamine h1 receptor  pdb code : 3rze ) .\nfor all these \n gpcr structures , we analyzed the content of the unit crystallographic \n cell and quantified for each tm helix ( 1 ) the frequency of its occurrence \n at the crystallographic contact interface and ( 2 ) the number of residue \n interactions each tm helix forms at the contact interface .\ncanonical  interfaces were considered , \n where the crystallographic contacts were formed exclusively through \n tm  tm interactions between monomers in parallel orientations .\nremarkably , we found that tmh1 and tmh5 , the two helices implicated \n in the largest residual mismatch in our simulations of rhodopsin with \n 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers , contribute to the most common contact interfaces \n in the crystallographic structures of the homologous gpcrs .\nmore specifically , \n as illustrated in figure s6a ( see supporting information ) , all but 4 of the 14 distinct intermolecular tm \ntm interfaces \n identified in this analysis , involve tmh1 and/or tmh5 . furthermore , \n examining the residues involved in the interactions at the contact \n interfaces revealed that the tmh1 stretch of residues in positions \n 1.291.34 ( that would include pro34 in the homologous \n rhodopsin gpcr ) contribute significantly to the formation of the crystallographic \n interface . during the final preparation of this manuscript , \n two new crystal \n structures of rhodopsin - like gpcrs ,\nthe -opioid receptor ( kor ) \n and the -opioid receptor ( mor ) were reported to be obtained \n by means of in meso crystallization .\nconsistent with the data presented above , the crystallographic interface \n of kor consists of tm1 , tm2 and h8 , with the n - terminal end of tm1 \n ( region harboring the residue homologous to pro34 in \n rhodopsin ) forming extensive dimeric contacts . for mor , two crystallographic \n interfaces were reported : the more prominent interface consisted of \n tm5/tm6 helices with the i256 residue ( aligning with \n the residue next to phe228 in rhodopsin ) residing at \n the dimer interface , and more limited contacts formed by tm1 , tm2 \n and h8 . taken together ,\nour findings support the mechanistic \n inferences \n that ( 1 ) the reduced level of hydrophobic mismatch in the lcp is attributable \n to the specific highly curved geometry of the cubic phase that provides \n for more coverage from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure ; ( 2 ) compared \n to the lcp , lamellar structures provide a more favorable setting in \n which gpcrs can oligomerize as a prelude to nucleation and crystal \n growth ; and ( 3 ) the extent of the residual mismatch penalty is likely \n one of the critical mechanistic factors that determines not only the \n drive for gpcr proteins to oligomerize during in meso crystallization , but also the structural elements that are likely \n to participate in contact interfaces .\nthese findings provide \n novel energy -

care facilities .\nanalgesics , antipyretics , antacids , cold and cough remedies , vitamins , nutrition supplements , and antibiotics constituted commonly dispensed drugs without prescription , in that order .\nsimilar patterns were also seen in the egypt and tanzania studies while in the vietnam study and another study conducted in india , antibiotics , vitamins , and nutrition supplements were most commonly dispensed . in another study conducted in saudi arabia , almost all the pharmacists dispensed antibiotics without prescription .\nanalgesics and antipyretics are the most commonly used drugs for relief of fever , common aches , and pains .\nalthough aspirin and paracetamol can be dispensed without prescription , they can lead to adverse outcomes under certain conditions and hence , there is a need for them to be dispensed at right doses with proper counseling of end users .\nother analgesics such as ibuprofen and diclofenac are prescription drugs . while antacids are among over - the - counter ( otc ) drugs , most of the cold and cough remedies and all the antibiotics are schedule h drugs .\nsome authors have also questioned the appropriateness of widespread use of cold and cough remedies , some vitamin preparations and their irrational combinations .\nthis scenario prevails even in the face of existing regulations as most pharmacies do not adhere to them . with bias\nbeing a known caveat of questionnaire surveys the actual situation could still be worse . in the uk ,\na prescription is valid for 6 months from the date of prescription , unless the medicine prescribed contains a controlled drug , in which case it is valid antibiotics and other drugs as otc medications . under the federal law ,\nprescriptions for schedule iii substances expire after 6 months and 5 refills are allowed within the 6-month period , whereas prescriptions for schedule ii controlled substances can not be refilled . in this study\n, it was found that 77% of the pharmacists dispensed drugs for older prescriptions also .\nthis could be due to no specific regulations in place regarding duration of validity of a prescription in our country .\nalthough antibiotics are an essential tool for modern medicine in combating most of the infections , antibiotic resistance remains to be a worldwide problem .\nwhile misuse of antibiotics is a key factor contributing to antibiotic resistance , failure to take an antibiotic as prescribed adds no less . only one - third of the pharmacists insisted on dispensing full course of the antibiotics prescribed and this improper dispensing can contribute to the growing health hazard of antibiotic resistance , which adds to health - care costs and\nthe gpp guidelines by the indian pharmaceutical association require the pharmacist , on receiving the prescription , to confirm the identity of the client , review the prescription for completeness , and check for correctness of the prescribed medications .\nthis is to ensure right dispensing and thus avoid contributing to medication errors at large , the stakes of which are high .\nhowever , in this study , 81% of the pharmacists said they would not check for all the particulars .\n, all of them did check for expiry of the medications before dispensing . maintaining an inventory , especially a computerized one ,\nin this study , we found that 41% of the pharmacies had a computerized inventory , 57% had manual inventory , and 2% did not maintain one . according to the gpp guidelines pharmacies should preferably be equipped with computers for inventory management .\nherbal medicines have emerged as a common choice of therapy for self - care as they are perceived to be free of side effects .\nthis practice is also enforced by irrational claims and aggressive promotions by manufacturers and media , peer views , and lack of well - documented unbiased studies on herbal drug use in disease conditions .\na study conducted in lagos , nigeria , showed that community pharmacies frequently supplied herbal medicines .\nfifty - seven percent of the pharmacies included in this study also dispensed herbal medicines . in the uk ,\nhuman medicines regulations 2012 allows only long - established and quality - controlled herbal medicines to be sold .\nit has also implemented the traditional herbal medicines registration scheme for authorizing the marketing of herbal products .\nmedication counseling is the duty of the modern community pharmacists through which they can significantly contribute to medication safety and patient compliance .\nthe gpp guidelines require the pharmacist to provide professional counseling with regard to the use of medicines , their side effects , and precautions , if any . recognizing the importance of medication counseling , the north carolina board of pharmacy since 1993 made a rule to offer patient counseling on all new prescriptions .\nhowever , a low rate of voluntary medication counseling by the pharmacists was noted in this study .\nthis could possibly be improved by modifying the attitude of pharmacists through educational interventions , incentives , and regulations .\ndrug storage practices , essential for maintaining efficacy of some drugs , were not in accordance with the gpp guidelines which states that pharmacies should be equipped with refrigerated storage facilities validated from time to time for products requiring storage at cold temperature . also having a refrigerator in the pharmacy is a licensing requirement .\nabout 3% of the pharmacies did not have a refrigerator and about 31% of the pharmacies which had a refrigerator did not have power back - up for the same .\nthis scenario is better than another study conducted in pakistan where the majority of the pharmacies did not have an alternative power supply for the refrigerator .\ngeneric substitution is the mutual substitution of medicinal products having the same active ingredient , in the same dose and pharmaceutical form .\nthis concept especially becomes important in case of biologicals and drugs with narrow therapeutic index .\ndisasters such as breakthrough seizures in epileptics due to disregard to the concept of generic substitution are well known .\nnevertheless , unaware of its implications , 56% said they would dispense an alternative brand of the same drug in case of nonavailability of the brand prescribed , irrespective of which drug it was .\nalthough guidelines for the same are in place in few countries , lack of such robust system in our country and unawareness can compound the problems faced in therapeutics .\nindian pharmaceutical industry is now the third - largest in the world with more than 20,000 registered units .\nthe potential for error due to confusing names among health - care personnel has also significantly increased .\npharmacists should , therefore , be cautious while dispensing such drugs and take steps to avoid dispensing errors such as sticking warning labels and avoid keeping lasa drugs in close proximity . however\n, in this study , the majority ( 88% ) did not know about lasa drugs . in all the pharmacies drugs\nrampant use of antibiotics and other drugs as otc medications can lead to serious adverse drug reactions and antibiotic resistance .\nhence , schedule h and schedule x of the drugs and cosmetic rules , 1945 , came into being .\nschedule h includes substances that could be sold by retail on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner only .\nschedule x drugs are those for which a retailer has to preserve the prescription for a period of 2 years .\nwhile schedule x has worked , schedule h implementation has been lax , necessitating the schedule h1 , with 46 drugs in its purview .\nschedule h1 came into effect from march 1 , 2014 , and contains prescription only drugs for which a copy of the prescription has to be preserved .\nonly about half of the pharmacists were aware of schedule h and 17.5% were updated with current regulations on schedule h1 .\nsixty - five percent of the pharmacists are not aware that prescription in duplicate and stringent dispensing records have to be maintained while dispensing schedule x drugs .\nknowledge and updated drug information is a must for people involved in drug dispensing to assure the quality of dispensing .\nhowever , most of them obtain their drug information in informal ways such as industry representatives and peers .\nthus , given the gap in knowledge of pharmacists and their unawareness of current regulations , their dispensing practices may undo the beneficial effects of the health - care system .\nhowever , a drug dispensing audit at pharmacies could have avoided the bias associated with a questionnaire - based study .\nfurthermore , simple random sampling instead of convenient sampling could have been more representative of all pharmacies in bengaluru city .\nthis study revealed improper dispensing practices at pharmacies in both residential and commercial areas of bengaluru city with a high proportion of dispensing encounters without prescription , a higher rate of older prescription refills and inadequate medication counseling , and storage practices .\nit also highlights lacunae in the knowledge of pharmacists about schedule h and current regulations pertaining to scheduled drugs .\na similar scenario seems to prevail elsewhere in india and in other developing countries of the world .\nhence , structured educational campaigns , generation , and implementation of otc list , and regulatory enforcement can better equip pharmacists for their main role of promoting rational drug use .", "human": " objectives : pharmacists are one of the crucial focal points for health care in the community . \n they have tremendous outreach to the public as pharmacies are often the first -

5 ] in the oral environment , orthodontic brackets are subjected to mechanical and chemical damaging which results in susceptibility to corrosion .\ncorrosion leads to loss of substance from the material , change in its structural characteristics , or loss of structural integrity . due to the electrolytic capabilities of saliva\nvarious types of brackets are commercially available and each demonstrates a unique pattern of corrosion . in soldered brackets ,\nthis corrosion is due to the presence of dissimilar metals ( i.e. the silver solder and the stainless steel ) , a phenomenon termed galvanic corrosion .\nmetal injection molding ( mim ) brackets are manufactured as a single unit and therefore do not demonstrate galvanic corrosion .\ncorrosion can have detrimental effects on the surface of stainless steel brackets due to the continuous loss of metal ions .\ncorrosion can increase the surface roughness of the bracket which leads to elevated friction forces between the bracket and the archwire .\nthis increase in friction results in unfavorable distribution of forces and reduces the effectiveness of archwire guided orthodontic tooth movement.[7 - 8 ] moreover , by means of increased stress , the friction would further accelerate the corrosion process .\nthe release of metal ions following the corrosion of brackets has concerned clinicians and has instigated research in this field . among these metal ions ,\nfurthermore , direct and prolonged contact of orthodontic appliances and the resulting corrosion products have been shown to cause local pain and swelling in the adjacent tissues .\nedema , gingivitis , gingival hyperplasia , perioral stomatitis , dna instability and altered cellular metabolism are among other reported side effects .\ncorrosion also has detrimental effects on the teeth , and permanent staining around the bracket base has been reported .\ndue to the wide diversity of options regarding bracket selection , orthodontists look for brackets which possess satisfactory biomechanical properties while presenting with a reasonable price .\nit was mentioned that corrosion has a detrimental effect on the physical properties of brackets and causes unwanted biological side effects ; therefore , brackets with minimal corrosion tendencies are more desirable . the present study aimed to investigate five different brands of stainless steel brackets and compare their tendency towards corrosion by measuring ion release in an in -

ethylene capped vials containing 10 ml of artificial saliva at a ph of 7.2 .\nthe vials were incubated at 37c for 6 weeks and then they were subjected to thermocycling with 500 temperature cycles from 5c to 55c to simulate the effect of temperature changes in the oral cavity .\nthe brackets were immersed in each bath for 30 seconds with 2 seconds at air temperature in -

17 ] this difference in ion release may be due to the fact that we chose to tie a segment of archwire to the bracket to better simulate conventional orthodontic treatment .\nfirst , by increasing the amount of alloy available to be subjected to corrosion and second , the potential for galvanic corrosion increases since the alloy for the archwire is different from the alloy used in the bracket .\nanother reason for greater levels of ion release may be due to the technique used for detection of ions .\nthe values obtained in the present study closely match the values presented by kuhta et al . who elected to use an icp device for ion detection . \n \nthe results of the present study indicated that soldered brackets do not necessarily demonstrate less resistance to corrosion when compared to brackets made by metal injection molding ( mim ) .\nwhen the org ( soldered ) and the dentaurum ( mim ) bracket are compared we observed that , except for iron which was released more by the dentaurum bracket , the other ions were not significantly different . while it has been argued that soldered brackets present a tendency towards galvanic corrosion , mim brackets have increased porosity rendering them susceptible to another kind of chemical breakdown , termed pitting corrosion .\nthis may be the reason why similar studies also found no measurable advantage regarding the utilization of mim brackets .\nthe presence of an archwire may be a confounding factor which may induce galvanic corrosion to mim brackets that cancels out any possible differences . \n \nthe results of the present study indicated that iron was released more than the other ions , followed by nickel .\nwhile this was the overall pattern , in the 3 m bracket , it was observed that manganese was released more than nickel .\nthis finding is in contrast to the findings of karnam et al . who reported that nickel was the major ion released from orthodontic brackets .\nthe findings of this study also suggest that there were no statistically significant differences between the 3 m and dentaurum brackets in any of the ions studied .\nthese differences could be due to study design , addition of an archwire element , testing conditions and measurement methods .\nit is noteworthy that in the present study , an icp - ms was used to measure the released ions .\nicp - ms has shown lower detection limit compared to atomic absorption spectrometry used in similar studies .\nanother advantage of the icp device over atomic absorption is that it can measure several ions simultaneously without interference from other ions .\nthis study in agreement with previous findings declares that the values of ions released from orthodontic brackets falls short of the permissible daily doses determined by the world health organization .\nthe maximum tolerable dose of nickel , iron , manganese and chromium for a 60-kg individual is 1.2 , 15 , 10 and 50 - 200 mg / day , respectively .\nhowever the chronic nature of metallic exposure resulting from orthodontic treatment is a cause for concern .\nit has been reported that chronic exposure to metal ions can cause alterations in cell morphology and metabolism leading to inflammation and dna instability.[21 -

{"article": "one of the common predicaments experienced by patients undergoing tooth preparation and cementation on vital tooth for crown and bridge restorations is dentinal hypersensitivity.1 the phenomenon of dentinal hypersensitivity is best explained by brannstroms hydrodynamic theory , which states that  when exposed , dentinal tubules are stimulated by changes in temperature or osmotic pressure resulting in displacement of tubular fluid .\nthis fluid movement is conveyed to the nerve fibers in the pulp , causing stimulation that is interpreted as pain or hypersensitivity .\n vital teeth that are prepared for restorations are at a risk of developing hypersensitivity because a large number of tubules are exposed during the tooth preparation . when teeth are prepared for complete crowns , approximately 1.2 - 1.5 mm of tooth structure is removed to ensure appropriate crown contours and adequate occlusal clearance.2 richardson et al . reported that approximately 1 - 2 million\ndentinal tubules are exposed during an average tooth preparation for a posterior crown.3 desiccation and frictional heat generated by the preparation also increases the chances of hypersensitivity.4 during the procedure of crown cementation , the cement is forced into the patent dentinal tubules before the luting agent sets , and displaces an equal amount of dentinal fluid , thus leading to excessive hydrostatic pressure and resultant irritation of pulpal tissues.1,5 the smear layer evident after tooth preparation was demonstrated to be ineffective against luting agent irritation . before cementation of the final prosthesis dentin can still become sensitive as a result of microleakage of the temporary restoration and the resultant formation of bacterial byproducts.6 oxalates , resin bonding agents , and formulations containing sodium fluoride or potassium ions have been documented to have desensitizing property by blocking the dentinal tubules.7 however , the effects of these agents are limited , and the hypersensitivity can recur in the future.8 tooth sensitivity after cementation of crowns , therefore , is a pertinent issue .\nthe use of low power low potency desensitizing laser treatment before cementation of crowns has shown to occlude exposed dentinal tubules and relieve the hypersensitivity for longer periods than any other desensitizing agents , and this procedure is growing in popularity the world over.9 it has been proved by sipahi et al .\nthat application of low - power low - potency desensitizing laser treatment has an effect on the tensile bond strength of full veneer crowns luted with glass - ionomer cement.10 however , the effect of laser desensitizing treatment on the crown retention , when resin cements are used , has not been documented .\nthis is of importance , because of the growing popularity of these cements due to their better physical and mechanical properties.11 the purpose of this study therefore was to assess , evaluate and compare the effect of desensitizing laser treatment on the bond strength of self - adhesive resin cement to glass - ionomer luting cement .\nthe teeth were mounted into a metal jig filled with softened impression compound with the aid of a surveyor , so as to enable the specimen to be mounted parallel to its long axis .\ntooth preparation of all the samples is planned . for bringing about standardization in the tooth preparation\n, it was mandatory for all the specimens to have a uniform taper , uniform length , and width . in order , to obtain uniform taper for the preparation a specially designed clamp\nwas fabricated , which was able to secure a high - speed air - rotor hand - piece to the surveyor .\nthe metal jig with the mounted tooth specimens were secured to the surveying table maintaining parallelism to the floor prior to starting the preparation .\na round end tapered diamond bur was used to prepare the occlusal surface of the premolars , to a depth of 1 mm below the central groove ( figure 1 ) . the axial reduction of teeth done up to a uniform depth of 1.5 mm with the help of depth - cut diamond bur and tapered chamfer bur . crown preparation using surveyor .\nthe surface area of the preparations thus obtained was calculated using a formula for truncated cone,12 which is described below : truncated cone area ac = 3.141  l ( r1 + r2 ) mm flat surface area a0 = 3.141  r2 mm surface area of preparation at = ac + a0 mm ac -

sem study done to understand the tubule - occluding effect of desensitizing laser treatment on prepared dentin surfaces by sipahi et al . observed that the application of desensitizing laser at 0.5 w potency without air and water can be done to reduce hypersensitivity of prepared abutment teeth in prosthodontics.9 according to this study , desensitizing laser application causes blockage and reduction in the size of patent dentinal tubules by deposition of dentinal debris created by micro explosion .\nthese observations can raise queries regarding the effect of desensitizing laser application on the bond strength of commonly used luting cements , viz : glass - ionomer and resin cements to treated dentin .\nhave also observed that the tensile bond strength of glass - ionomer luting cement to the abutment tooth decreased by 15% after laser application.10 however , there are not many studies currently available on the bond strength of self - adhesive resin cements to desensitizing laser treated teeth .\nit is imperative to understand the bond strength of self - adhesive resin cement to laser irradiated teeth , as these cements are gaining in popularity as a luting agent due to their improved mechanical and physical properties.11 this study therefore was done to assess and compare the tensile bond strength of crowns luted with glass - ionomer and resin cements to laser irradiated prepared abutment tooth , and control group . within the limitations of this study\n, it was found that laser treatment on dentine appreciably decreased the tensile bond strength of crowns luted with glass - ionomer cements .\nhowever , the bond strength of self - adhesive resin cement remained unaffected with a marginal increase in strength , it was not statistically significant .\nthe results of the present study with glass - ionomer cement are concurrent with the findings of a previous study by sipahi et al.10 the mechanism of adhesion of glass - ionomer cement to dentinal surface is through an ionic bond between negatively charged polyacid chains of the ionomer matrix and the positively charged calcium on the tooth surface.16 these polyacids also form hydrogen bonds and undergo ion exchange in the collagen and the inorganic components of the tooth structure , particularly to calcium , carboxylate and phosphate ions of the tooth surface.17 the formation of dentinal debris formed during laser application as observed in sem picture in this study probably would have interfered with the above mentioned chemical bondage of glass - ionomer cement with the exposed dentinal surface leading to loss of bond strength .\nthe desiccation of collagen fibrils due to laser application may also be another reason , leading to decreased bond strength due to the weak hydrogen bonds and poor ion exchange in the dentinal collagen.18 the bond strength of the samples luted with self- adhesive resin cements remaining unaffected or showing a marginal increase in bond strength may be due to the following reasons . \n the ability of resin cement to partially decalcify the smear layer and the dentin leading to the formation of short -

{"article": "stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide , and the leading cause of neurological disability in adults in developed countries.1 \n 2 recognised risk factors include high blood pressure , heart disease , diabetes , obesity , smoking , alcohol and physical inactivity , but further environmental factors are likely to be relevant to stroke risk .\nexposure to psychosocial stress has been identified by several recently conducted studies as a possible stroke risk.35 psychosocial stress , particularly with chronic exposure , is a feasible risk for stroke through its influence on the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( hpa ) axis and sympathetic nervous system , which can result in inflammation and altered metabolic and cardiac autonomic control.6 moreover , stress may be related to lifestyle factors relevant to stroke risk , such as cigarette smoking , physical inactivity and alcohol intake.7 to date , the association between psychosocial stress and stroke has been investigated incompletely.8 recent case - control studies investigating this may have been limited by potential reporting bias , and exclusion of subjects who experienced fatal stroke , as the measure of exposure to stress was collected after onset of stroke.4 \n 9 \n 10 while some prospective studies have been performed,3 \n 5 limited duration of follow - up has not allowed examination of chronic exposure , which may be of particular relevance .\nstress susceptibility  or stress resilience  is an important determinant of the consequences of exposure to stress.11 \n 12 a poorly controlled stress response ( potentially signalled by low stress resilience ) results in a prolonged physiological response to stressful exposures , thus increasing the possible longer - term adverse consequences of psychosocial stress .\nstress resilience may be a useful and underused measure for investigating the consequences of chronic stress in relation to stroke risk . here\n, we examine the association of stress resilience in adolescence with subsequent stroke risk in middle age within a general population - based cohort of male swedish residents . stress resilience was measured during the assessment for military conscription over 10  years prior to stroke and , therefore , not subject to differential reporting bias .\na secondary aim was to examine whether other risk factors might mediate associations of stress resilience with stroke risk . at the end of follow - up\nthe subjects were still relatively young , under age 60  years , so the study is of stroke risk during working age rather than the later ages when stroke is more common .\nthe study cohort consists of male swedish residents born between 1952 and 1956 , who were eligible for military conscription and included in the swedish military conscription register.13 at this time , conscription and the associated examinations were mandatory for all male citizens of the appropriate age ( 18 and 19  years , with a small number at later ages ) . during the years covered by this study , only men with significant disability or a severe chronic disease were exempted from conscription ( approximately 23% annually).14 the assessments included extensive and highly standardised physical and psychological examinations by physicians and psychologists .\nstroke risk was assessed from 1987 ( when the swedish national inpatient register15 attained full coverage ) to 2010 . from among a total of 284  198 men\nidentified , we excluded 2564 subjects with unreliable data such as errors in the personal identification number or uncertain vital status . those with implausible values for height ( less than 144  cm ) , weight ( above 178  kg ) , body mass index , bmi , ( below 15 ) , systolic blood pressure ( below 50 or above 230  mm  hg ) and diastolic blood pressure ( below 30 or above 135  mm  hg ) , were also excluded from the analysis ; in total 225 men.16 after excluding individuals who emigrated , died , or had a diagnosis of stroke before study entry in 1987 , the sample comprised 271  767 men .\nmen with missing data for stress resilience , potential confounding factors ( year of birth , geographic region , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , bmi , cognitive function , physical working capacity , parental socioeconomic index and household crowding ) were also excluded ( 37  196 men ; including 722 men with a stroke diagnosis at some time ) .\nthe sample available for the main analysis comprised 237  879 men , 84% of the potential target population .\nthe men underwent a psychological examination to assess their potential ability to cope with war -

based cohort of men are consistent with recent studies suggesting a role for psychosocial stress in influencing stroke risk.35 \n 9 \n 10 similarly , poorer adaptation to social adversity  possibly signalling lower stress resilience  has also been linked with an increased risk of stroke.22 stress resilience in adolescence does not measure exposure to stress but does indicate susceptibility , such that the adversities of daily life may have a greater impact and conspire to produce a more chronic pattern stress arousal over adult life . another study has found associations with stress independent of lifestyle factors.4 this difference with our findings may be due to methodological variations , as we have a measure of resilience rather than stress exposure , it was collected prospectively , many years before stroke , and we adjusted for some characteristics in adolescence that may themselves be consequences of low stress resilience , as discussed below .\nwe hypothesise that low resilience to psychosocial stress could indicate exposure to psychosocial stress in earlier life , resulting in poorer control of the stress response that can continue across the life course .\nanimal studies have demonstrated that early life stress can alter hpa axis function in a way that can persist over the life course , producing persistent low resilience to stress.23 \n 24 stress resilience may also be a characteristic of personality type , and thus , a persistent trait .\nfor example , low resilience may reflect something like type a behaviour which , although controversial , has previously been related to increased cardiovascular risk.25 it has been demonstrated that adverse socioeconomic conditions in childhood increase stroke risk26 ; so we adjusted for such factors , with little impact on the association of stress resilience with stroke .\nmarkers of early life exposure to stress have been linked with poorer cognitive development27 and higher blood pressure.28 thus , cognitive function and blood pressure may represent consequences of earlier stressful exposures and poorer stress resilience , and adjusting for these factors may have produced conservative estimates of association ; arguably an over - adjustment .\nmarkers of stressful exposures in early life are also linked with unhealthy weight gain,29 which may influence physical exercise or be a consequence of low exercise levels.30 thus , even in adolescence , bmi and fitness could , in part , be a consequence of lower stress resilience and earlier stressful exposures .\nwe believe the results suggest that a significant proportion of the association of stress and stress resilience with stroke risk is due to lifestyle risk factors .\nthis is consistent with recent findings from a british cohort study with older participants , where the association of psychological distress with cvd risk was largely explained by behavioural / lifestyle processes.31 our findings suggest such processes have a long natural history , beginning in childhood or adolescence .\nour results were consistent among the different stroke subtypes ( fatal , non - fatal , ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke ) although there may be pathological heterogeneity .\nprevious studies investigating the association between psychosocial stress and stroke subtypes are few , but the results are mostly consistent with our findings suggesting a more notable association for fatal than for non - fatal stroke , and for haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke\n. the stronger association with haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke could also be a consequence of a greater aetiological heterogeneity in ischaemic stroke . physical working capacity and bmi in adolescence most notably attenuated that association of stress resilience with ischaemic stroke , suggesting more significant mediation through lifestyle factors .\nas this is a study of stress resilience measured in adolescence , it is possible that stressful exposures in adult life might represent a higher risk of stroke , particularly chronic exposures among the less stress resilient .\noverweight , obesity and poorer physical capacity in adolescence are likely to signal an accumulation of behavioural / lifestyle health risks that continue through adulthood.32 \n 33 other lifestyle risks in the years between conscription and stroke , such as smoking , alcohol and diet , are also likely to be relevant mediating factors .\nfurther mediating factors might include type 2 diabetes , a stroke risk which tends to have its onset in adulthood some years after the time of conscription , which has also been linked with psychosocial stress.34 \n 35 as behaviours and diagnoses occurring between conscription and stroke are intermediate in the causal pathway , we have not included them in the model .\nunfortunately , we have no data on smoking , diet or alcohol consumption , which could have added further to our understanding of lifestyle risks .\nthus , major mediation between poor stress resilience and stroke risk may be through lifestyle factors and fitness , suggesting interventions for psychosocial stress and behaviour might be most effective in lowering stoke risk among younger men .\nthe use of prospectively recorded data from several linked registers , and the long - term follow - up subsequent to the measure of susceptibility , increases the validity and reliability of the study , as well as avoiding bias due to reverse causation or poor recall .\nthe study population is largely representative of the male general population as only a small proportion of swedish men were exempted from enlistment examinations .\nextensive physical and psychological examinations were conducted in adolescence , so the information was objectively measured and were able to adjust for a variety of powerful stroke risk factors including , bmi and physical capacity which are objective physiological measures .\nthe duration between conscription examination and start of follow - up means it is unlikely that prodromal characteristics of an impending stroke were driving the stress resilience measure , and it was possible to identify pre - existing cardiovascular diagnoses and adjust for blood pressure .\nthe potential limitations of the study include the inclusion of only men , as women also suffer from stroke .\nthis was necessary as the measure of stress susceptibility was collected during military conscription , which at the time was almost exclusively available to men . as stress resilience\nwas only measured once , we can not be definitive about stability of this characteristic over time and how this may interact with stressful exposures . in these data ,\nthe association of stress resilience with stroke risk did not vary by age , indicating that this measure of stress resilience is a relatively stable characteristic over time , at least in terms of stroke risk .\nthere is a possibility of misclassification of the stress resilience measure if potential conscripts attempted to obtain exemption from military service through\nfalse answers , if they exist , would most likely dilute the resilience measure and result in less precise estimates .\nthe temporal relationship of stress resilience and physical fitness in adolescence can not be established , but we hypothesise that poor stress resilience has an adverse influence on physical fitness . as stressful exposures were not examined , it is possible that the magnitude of associations with stress resilience is conservative\n. a proportion of the cardiovascular diagnoses at conscription when the men in our cohort were 1819 years old may not be directly relevant to stroke risk .\nwe included this information in the models to ensure that poorer stress resilience was not a function of pre - existing cardiovascular disease , where a proportion of these diseases may increase subsequent stroke risk .\nmost stroke onset occurs at a higher age than in our study , so early stroke may be somewhat atypical and the aetiology may differ from stroke at older ages.36 however , stroke incidence in younger adults ( younger than 55  years of age ) is increasing.37 stroke at young ( working ) age is a particular concern , as a reduction of working capacity increases the personal , social as well as economic burden of the disease .\nthis is of public health significance , as stroke at early ages has the potential for greater lifetime burden of disability , and because some risks may be modifiable .\nthe proportion of stroke diagnoses in the analytic sample is lower than among those who were not included .\nthis is for two reasons , and the first is that men who had a stroke at an early age , close in time to the conscription examination , were excluded deliberately to avoid associations due to reverse causation .\nsome men in poor health , with very low levels of physical fitness , or low cognitive function at the time of the conscription examination , were identified as unsuitable for military service by the assessors and may not have completed all the examinations ( including for stress resilience ) . as these men  excluded due to missing values on the assessments  may have the greatest risk of stroke , we may have underestimated the proportion at risk and conceivably produced a conservative estimate of stroke risk .\nthe validity of some diagnoses recorded in the swedish national inpatient register can be questionable , but the reliability of stroke diagnoses is satisfactory.38 \n 39\nthe use of prospectively recorded data from several linked registers , and the long -

42c ) .\nthese studies , along with the case described here , show that immersion in deep hot water can trigger an arrhythmogenic event which could lead to drowning in the bath water in individuals with an inherited or acquired heart disease .\nwe recently reported the significance of postmortem genetic analysis using ngs for both sud syndrome and sud with epilepsy cases in young people to explore the cause of such death if pathological change of the heart is not evident .\nthe present case is notable in that detection of rare gene variants suggested that the deceased might have had undiagnosed arrhythmogenic potential which could cause sudden loss of consciousness during bathing .\nhowever , we should note the limitations involved in interpretation of the detected variants found by ngs analysis .\nwe frequently depend on population databases and in silico analyses to evaluate the pathogenicity of detected variants because functional or genetic analysis of family members , the criterion standard method for evaluating the pathogenicity of genetic variants , can be difficult in some cases . however , the evaluations obtained from different in silico analyses do not always correspond , as shown in our case .\nguidelines for interpreting sequence variants recommend that several in silico analyses should be used to evaluate the pathogenicity of arrhythmia - related gene variants because most algorithms used for missense variant prediction are only 65% to 80% accurate when examining known disease variants .\nin addition , le scouarnec et al and kapplinger et al indicated that identification of a variant does not confirm the presence of the disease because many of the variants found in brugada syndrome patients were also identified in the control population . genetic analysis using ngs\nmay provide significantly useful information about the mechanism of sud in some conditions , but careful and comprehensive evaluation of the detected variants is needed when the evaluation for pathogenicity differs across a range of predictive procedures .\nscn5a_p.gln289ser is a very rare variant , not only in eas but across the world .\n however , 1 patient with long qt syndrome has been reported to have this variant .\nin addition , although the relevance of drinking alcohol to sud occurring in hot baths is not fully understood , some researchers consider that ethanol intake may increase the chance of developing atrial fibrillation , a prolonged qt interval , and sud as the combination of pathogenic genetic variants and alcohol intake might increase the risk of sudden arrhythmogenic events occurring in hot baths .\nthe cacnb2_p.ser502leu variant is rare but has a relatively high incidence in eas , yet 5 of 8 in silico tools evaluated this variant as pathogenic .\nthe l -

{"article": "  walking ability is impaired in patients with peripheral arterial disease ( pad ) due to decreased blood flow to the skeletal muscle tissue used during walking .\nit has been demonstrated that walking distance is associated with the degree of impairment in the affected leg as measured by the ankle - brachial index ( abi ) and the time to onset of claudication pain [ 16 ] .\nlikewise , it has been shown that walking exercise in patients with pad prolongs the onset of claudication pain thus allowing the patient to walk longer but does not change the abi [ 79 ] .  \nrecently , several investigators have used near - infrared spectroscopy ( nirs ) to dynamically study the effect of walking on oxygen desaturation of the gastrocnemius muscle of the impaired leg during exercise [ 2 , 1014 ] .\ninvestigators noted a marked decline in skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation ( sto2 ) during walking exercise [ 2 , 1014 ] .\ngardner et al . also identified that the rate of decline in calf muscle sto2 was significantly associated with initial claudication time and absolute claudication time in patients with pad .\nthree of the above studies examined the changes in tissue oxygenation , using nirs , in patients with pad before and after an exercise training program [ 1214 ] .\nused a pretest - post - test design and reported greater exercise duration and lower mean exercise sto2 in 15 patients after a 3-month treadmill and calf exercise training program .\nstudied 55 patients with pad who were given the option to participate in a structured or unstructured home exercise program for 34  2 weeks . at the end of the study , those patients in the structured exercise program had an increased oxyhemoglobin area under the curve when compared to baseline ; similar changes were not identified in the unstructured exercise group .\nlastly , tew et al .   studied calf - tissue oxygenation and treadmill walking response time after randomization to 12 weeks of arm - crank ergometry or a control group in 57 patients with intermittent claudication .\ninvestigators identified that walking distance and time to nadir sto2 increased in those assigned to arm - cranking and there were no changes in the control group .\nno studies however compared leg muscle responses after a traditional walking program compared to a walking - with - poles program of rehabilitation in patients with claudication .  \nthe purpose of this study was to determine if there were differences in calf muscle sto2 parameters before and after 12 weeks of a traditional walking program versus a walking - with - poles exercise program .\nwe reasoned that by using the poles to offload the legs , patients would have less claudication pain and be able to walk longer distance thus achieving a greater training effect .\nwe hypothesized that the calf muscle tissue deoxygenation would be less in both groups after 12 weeks of exercise training than at baseline and that the decrease would be greater in those patients assigned to the walking - with - poles group .\nthese data represent a subanalysis of data from a larger clinical trial comparing traditional walking to walking with poles .\npatients with pad were screened and recruited to participate in a randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effects of a traditional walking training program versus walking - with - poles exercise training program .\na total of 2296 patients were screened for eligibility , 146 enrolled in the study .\npatients were recruited using radio and newspaper advertising , posted fliers , and letters of invitation sent to patients at the university and va hospitals . for the purposes of this analysis\n, we included only those participants with an abi of 0.90 ( n = 91 patients ) .\nof those 91 patients , 3 did not have sto2 analyses on their baseline progressive treadmill test due to equipment malfunction and 3 had questionable data resulting in a final sample of 85 patients .\nof those 85 patients , 45 were assigned to the walking - with - poles group and 40 patients were assigned to the traditional walking group .  \nthe major study was a randomized clinical trial to examine the effects of a traditional walking program compared to walking with poles on walking endurance and perceived physical function in patients with pad .\nour primary outcome focused on changes the patients realized walking on the constant work rate treadmill test whereas this analysis used data from the progressive treadmill test . at two minutes on the constant work rate test , the speed and incline increased to 85% of the patient 's workload on the progressive treadmill test resulting in a sudden decline in sto2 . due to the gentle nature of the progressive treadmill protocol used , we were able to detect more subtle changes in sto2 and onset of claudication pain .   \npatients were randomized using computer - generated permuted blocks and group assignment was managed by the study statistician .\nthe training programs for both groups were identical except that one group exercised with poles and the other group did not .\npatients assigned to the walking - with - poles group received training on the use of the poles prior to beginning the exercise program .\nadditionally , patients were coached on proper poling mechanics during the training period if needed .\nthe training program incorporated interval training whereby exercise consisted mostly of low - to - moderate intensity training at the start of the program and progressed to moderate - to - high intensity .\nexercise intensity was determined by heart rate associated with a percentage of oxygen uptake obtained during the metabolic exercise treadmill tests .\nexercise duration and intensity was adjusted every three weeks . during the first weeks , patients walked for 30 minutes ( 20% light intensity , 60% moderate intensity , and 20% hard intensity ) . by weeks 1012 , patients walked for 55 minutes ( 10% light intensity , 45% moderate intensity , and 45% hard intensity ) .\nlight intensity was defined as 2544% peak vo2 , moderate intensity was 4559% peak vo2 , and hard intensity was 6084% vo2 peak .\nthe program was designed so that patients walked on the treadmill two days / week and outdoors or in the hospital corridors one day / week . the exercise interval was adjusted based on the patient 's pain tolerance .\nfor example , some patients could only walk for one to two minutes at the higher intensities . in order for them to achieve 20% total time at the harder intensities ,\ndemographic information , height , weight , comorbid conditions , and medication history were obtained from the patient and reviewed in the patient medical record .\nthe abi was measured in the more severely affected leg at baseline and 12 weeks after training .\nthe location of the signal was recorded and used consistently throughout the study for that individual subject .\nafter the patient rested comfortably in a supine position for 15 minutes , doppler ultrasound was used to measure the systolic pressure in the right and left arms and in the ankle of the most severely affected leg . the arm with the highest systolic pressure\npatients were tested using a gentle treadmill protocol that was developed for patients with pad [ 6 , 16 ] .\nincreases in percent grade occurred every 30 seconds , and , after the first 6 minutes , speed increased every 3 minutes .\ninitial claudication time was defined as the time during the treadmill test when the subject experienced pain in the affected leg . the absolute walking time was defined as the time walked by the patient on the progressive treadmill test .\npeak oxygen uptake was measured using the medgraphics cpx / d system ( medical graphics corp , st .\nthe metabolic cart was calibrated using a 3  l syringe prior to each test and the analyzers were calibrated using references gasses and room air .\npatients breathed through a mouthpiece and their nose was clipped with a standard nose clip .\noxygen uptake was averaged over 30  s and the highest value at peak exercise was recorded .\nskeletal muscle tissue oxygenation was measured prior to , during , and after exercise using the nirs spectrometer ( inspectra 325 , hutchinson technology , inc . ,\na 25  mm probe attached to an optical cable was used to noninvasively measure the percentage of hemoglobin oxygen saturation of the tissue beneath the near - infrared light .\nthe inspectra machine was calibrated prior to each test according to known high and low reference standards .\nthe nirs probe was attached to the medial section of the gastrocnemius muscle of the patient 's most severely affected leg .\nthe probe was placed into a specially designed adhesive housing unit to reduce ambient light .\nthe probe was then secured to the leg to avoid excessive motion and possible tripping .\nthe sto2 values used in this analysis were the sto2 value recorded after 2 minutes of standing prior to exercise ( sto2 rest ) , time walked when the patient reached the nadir sto2 value ( time to nadir sto2 value ) , sto2 value at peak exercise ( sto2 peak ) , and absolute and relative drop in sto2 ( absolute drop in sto2 = rest sto2  minimal sto2 value , relative drop in sto2 = [ rest sto2  nadir sto2 value]/rest sto2 )\n. ratings of perceived leg pain were obtained every minute using the borg ratio scale .\nthe initial claudication time is the time that patients either notified the staff of the onset of pain or the time they first reported pain when asked every minute .  \nthe two groups were compared at baseline using the t - test for independent samples and mann whitney u test .\nregression analyses were used to compute the initial decline in slopes for sto2 values ( sto2 value regressed over time ) .\npearson r correlations were completed to examine relationships between the variables . paired t - tests\nindependent t - tests were used to examine differences between groups . intent - to - treat analyses using the baseline value carried forward were completed for the comparisons between groups .\nthe sample consisted of primarily older ( age = 69.4  9.2 years ) men .\nover one - third of the patients were current smokers , half were diabetic , and the majority of patients received treatment for hypertension and dyslipidemia ( table 1 ) .\npatients were generally unfit with a peak oxygen uptake of 14.3  2.9  ml  kg  min. the walking - with - poles group was older than the traditional walking group .\ncalf muscle oxygenation decreased from 56  17% prior to the treadmill test to 16  18% at peak exercise ( 71% relative decline from rest to peak exercise ) .\npatients walked 4.45  3.67 minutes before experiencing claudication pain and 4.39  3.99 minutes when the sto2 reached its nadir value .\nthere was no difference between the time elapsed when the sto2 reached its nadir value and pain onset ( p = .87 ) .\nalthough all patients reported claudication pain , exercise was not limited by claudication pain for all patients .\ntherefore , we examined the onset of claudication pain and time to nadir sto2 for those whose exercise was limited by claudication pain only ( n = 72 ) .\npatients walked 3.35  2.57 minutes before experiencing claudication pain and 3.67  3.49 minutes when the sto2 reached its nadir value .\nthere was no difference between the time elapsed when the sto2 reached its nadir value and pain onset ( p = .40 ) .\nafter exercise , the time for the sto2 to return to half of its resting value was 1.3  1.3  min and 2.2  2.1 minutes to return to resting values . the initial claudication time and absolute walking time\nwere not associated with the sto2 values at rest ( table 2 ) but were moderately related to the time elapsed prior to reaching the nadir sto2 value ( r = .42 , p < .001 ; r = .58 , p = .001 , resp . ) .\nthere was also a small to moderate relationship between onset of claudication pain and the exercise slope decline in sto2 ( r = .28 , p = .011 ) .\nrelationships were similar between initial claudication time and absolute walking time and the time elapsed prior to reaching the nadir sto2 values when the analysis was restricted to those whose exercise was limited by claudication ( r = 48 , p  .001 and r = .47 , p < .001 ) .\ndata comparing groups after exercise training were analyzed using intent - to - treat analysis for all patients . the change in time elapsed\nprior to reaching nadir sto2 values between baseline and 12 weeks was related to the change in absolute walking time between baseline and 12 weeks ( r = .65 , p < .001 ) and initial claudication time at 12 weeks ( r = .33 , p = .002 ) .\nanalysis of covariance was completed to compare the groups with age as the covariate since there was a difference in age at baseline ( table 3 ) .\nthe change in the time elapsed prior to reaching nadir sto2 values ( p = .002 ) and absolute walking time ( p = .002 ) were greater in the traditional walking group when compared to the walking - with - poles group .\nthere was , however , no difference in the change in initial claudication time between the two groups ( p = .38 ) .  \nwhen the analyses were restricted to those who completed the exercise training only ( n = 71 ) , the change in time elapsed prior to reaching nadir sto2 values between baseline and 12 weeks was related to the change in absolute walking time between baseline and 12 weeks ( r = .57 , p < .001 ) and initial claudication time at 12 weeks ( r = .32 , p = .004 ) . data from a sample patient are depicted in figure 1 .\nrecovery time was unchanged when baseline and 12-week values were compared ( baseline = 2.45  2.17  min , 12  wk = 2.19  1.94  min , p = .81 ) .\nafter 12 weeks of exercise training , within - group changes in initial claudication time , absolute claudication time and time elapsed prior to reaching nadir sto2 values increased ( table 4 . ) the time elapsed prior to reaching nadir sto2 values increased more in the traditional walking group when compared to the walking - with - poles group ( walking group = 4.01  5.13 minutes , walking - with - poles group = .89  3.56 minutes , p = .009 ) .\nsimilarly , absolute walking time increased more in the traditional walking group than in the walking - with - poles group ( walking group = 3.97  3.14 minutes , walking - with - poles group = 2.24  2.41 minutes , p = .017 ) .\nthere was no difference between the two groups in initial claudication time ( walking group = 1.16  3.64 minutes , walking - with - poles group = .85  3.46 minutes , p = .69 ) . since there was a significant difference in age between the two groups , age\nno differences in recovery time were noted between the traditional walking and walking - with - poles groups at the 12-week follow - up time period ( traditional walking recovery time = 1.26  1.43  min , walking with poles = 1.41  1.76  min , p = .70 ) .\nno significant differences were identified in peak oxygen consumption or abi within or between the two groups from baseline to 12 weeks using intent - to - treat analysis or restricting the analysis to those who completed the training only .\n  there are three major findings of this study : ( 1 ) the time elapsed before reaching nadir sto2 values is associated with initial claudication time and absolute walking time , ( 2 ) there was no difference in the time associated with the nadir of sto2 and the onset of claudication pain , and ( 3 ) the time to nadir sto2 of the gastrocnemius muscle was greater after 12 weeks of exercise training in the traditional walking group when compared to the walking with poles group .    as bauer notes , during higher work rates and apparent blood flow limitation , muscle oxygen desaturation becomes more rapid in pad subjects .\nthus , one would expect that oxygen desaturation would be associated with onset of claudication and walking duration .\nour findings reflect these assumptions and were similar to those reported by gardner et al .\n, that is , shorter time to reach nadir sto2 values were associated with shorter initial claudication time and total walking duration .\nsecond , in gardner 's study , relationships between initial claudication time ( r = .339 ) , absolute walking time ( r = .68 ) and measured time to minimal exercise sto2 were similar to our relationships between initial claudication time ( r = .42 ) , absolute walking time ( r = .58 ) and measured distance to nadir sto2 .\nthese findings suggest that our sample patients were similar to patients in other studies [ 2 , 19 ] .  \nexercise - associated decline in sto2 of the gastrocnemius muscle was less after 12 weeks of exercise training when compared to baseline .\nwang and colleagues recently demonstrated in 17 subjects with pad who completed a 24-week walking program that an increase in the number of capillaries in contact with type iix and iia calf muscle fibers was related to an improved pain - free walking time ( r = .69 and r = .62 , p < .05 ) .\ninvestigators hypothesized that the ratio of capillaries to muscle fibers affects oxygen supply thus delaying the mismatch between supply and demand .\nboth report greater exercise sto2 area under the curve postexercise training when compared to preexercise training . in our study ,\nan increase in the time to nadir sto2 values was associated with delayed initial claudication time and improved absolute walking time .\nour findings provide further evidence that walking exercise improves tissue muscle oxygenation in patients with pad .\nlikewise , our findings support the possibility that the onset of claudication and walking duration are linked by the decline in tissue oxygenation .\nthe onset of claudication and the time elapsed prior to reaching the nadir sto2 values were nearly identical .\nthus , the patient 's perception of pain is a good indicator of sto2 in the calf muscle .\nexercise - induced decline in gastrocnemius muscle sto2 was less in patients assigned to the traditional walking program than in patients assigned to the walking - with - poles exercise training program .\nwe had originally hypothesized that a walking training program with poles for patients would be advantageous because the poles would  offload  the legs during periods of claudication allowing additional walking exercise .\nindeed , oakley et al .   investigated the immediate effects of walking with nordic poles on 20 patients with pad and found that claudication distance increased from 77  m without the poles to 130  m with the poles ( p < .0001 ) and the level of claudication pain also decreased ( p = .0002 ) .\nour group has also previously reported that patients had decreased calf pain when walking with poles .\noakley et al .   compared muscle histology of 36 patients randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treadmill training , strength training or control .\nafter the 12 weeks , only the treadmill group had histological changes in the muscle .\nthe increase in muscle ischemia with treadmill training was associated with a marked increase in muscle damage .\nhiatt suggests that skeletal muscle dysfunction and associated muscle metabolic state can be ameliorated with treadmill exercise training .\ntew et al .   provides evidence that even when the exercising muscle is not the calf muscle , tissue oxygenation can improve .\nclearly , the patients assigned to the traditional walking group experienced a prolonged exercise time before experiencing claudication pain , prolonged their absolute walking time and increased the amount of time exercising until reaching nadir values . in the walking - with - poles group\n, there were no changes over time when an intent - to - treat approach was used .\nhowever , when the analysis was restricted to those who completed the training program only , there was a difference in absolute walking time and a trend toward increasing time to initial claudication pain onset as well as nadir sto2 .\nthe explanation for these findings may be that leg metabolic changes in the calf muscle occurred to a greater extent in those assigned to the walking - with - poles group or we may not have had enough statistical power to detect changes that were present .\nanother explanation for this finding may be that the intensity of our training program was based on oxygen uptake associated with heart rate response to exercise . with the addition of the upper body to the exercise regime for patients assigned to the walking - with - poles group\nthus , the work accomplished by the leg muscles may have been less even though overall exercise intensity was consistent between the two groups of patients . both groups trained on the treadmill and outdoors .\npatients assigned to the walking with poles group were unable to use the handrails on the treadmill for balance ; added anxiety may have increased the cardiovascular response thus keeping the overall work accomplished lower in some patients .  \nfirst , although age was not a contributing factor to the differences between the groups , the walking - with - poles group was older than the traditional walking group .\nwe can not exclude that the differences in exercise tolerance and willingness to push limits may differ between someone who is 67 years old ( mean age for walking group ) and someone who is 72 years old ( mean age for walking - with - poles group ) .\nthis five - year age difference may have influenced our outcomes in ways that we did not measure .\nnext , the sample was primarily men and thus can not be generalized to women .\nadditionally , in order to include only those with compressible vessels , we excluded 17 patients who were initially randomized to our study .\nlastly , although all of our patients experienced claudication pain , not all patients stopped exercise due to claudication pain . including patients that did not stop exercise due to claudication pain\nadditional studies examining different walking intensities in patients with peripheral arterial disease should be tested .\nfurther , it may be that use of walking poles early in the rehabilitative effort may augment traditional walking training later by assisting patients to train longer early on .\nin summary , we conclude that there is a significant decline in sto2 in the gastrocnemius muscle during walking exercise in patients with peripheral arterial disease reflecting muscle tissue ischemia .\ncontrary to our hypothesis , after 12 weeks of exercise training , absolute walking time and time to reach nadir muscle tissue oxygenation were prolonged in the patients assigned to the traditional walking program more than those assigned to a walking -

up appointment was a mean of 6.05  0.86 months later .   as we have previously reported , international adoptees had significant growth failure upon arrival , which was more severe in children with low birth weight ( lbw , < 2500  g ; n = 34/104 , 32.7% ) and high risk for fas ( n = 10/132 , 7.6% ) .\nall three growth parameters were affected ; 22% of children were < 2 sds for height , 34% were < 2 sds for weight , and 12% were < 2 sds for ofc .\nten percent of children were wasted at baseline using weight -

i nor igfbp-3 sds was an independent predictor of delta ht sds . also , children in the lowest tertile of igf-1 sds were significantly more likely to show height cug than those in the highest tertile ( p = .042 , or = 4.9 , 95%ci : 1.122.9 ) .  \nalthough associated with baseline growth failure , lbw and being at high risk for fas were not significant predictors of cug in height .   however , low risk for fas children was more likely to show height cug than the high risk for fas children ( p = .007 , or = 34.8 , 95%ci : 2.7457.6 ) . excluding high risk for fas children from the regression analysis did not change the significant predictors\n. mid - arm circumference and baseline weight for height were not independently predictive of baseline height sds or degree of height cug .    because of the important role of nutrition in growth , we analyzed caloric intake at baseline and six months using a three - day diet record .\nmean caloric intake was higher than the dri at arrival ( % dri = 135  42 ; kcal / kg = 108  33 ) and was increased further at six months ( % dri = 157  42 ; kcal / kg = 125  34 ; p < .001 ) ( table 1 ) . at baseline ,\n76% of children were consuming greater than the dri ( 100% ) increasing to 93% at six months .  \nalthough mean height velocity was higher in younger children ( figure 2 ) and in those with higher caloric intake ( table 2 ) , the mean increases in caloric intake per kg did not significantly differ across different ages ( p > .3 by anova ) ( figure 3 ) .  \nthose children who had cug ( gain in height > + 0.5 sds ) had statistically significantly higher caloric intake at both baseline and 6 months ( table 3 ) compared with other children .  \ncaloric intake at 6 months was significantly correlated with subsequent change in height sds ( r = 0.318 , p = .001 ) .  \nchildren in the highest tertile of caloric intake / kg at the initial visit were also significantly more likely to show height cug than those in the lowest tertile of kcal / kg ( p = .033 , or = 4.2 , 95%ci : 1.115.9 ) .  \nrelatively lower baseline weight sds , higher birth weights , higher caloric intake , and lower baseline igfbp-3 sds were significant positive independent predictors of change in weight sds ( table 2 ) .\ncaloric intake at 6 months was also significantly correlated with the change in weight sds ( r = 0.441 , p <\nofc sds and ht sds were independent predictors of growth in ofc , so that children with relatively smaller heads and greater heights at baseline had the most improvement in subsequent head growth ( table 2 ) .  \nif children who were high risk for fas were excluded from the analysis , ht sds was no longer a significant independent predictor of subsequent ofc growth .   \nchildren who remained stunted were significantly older ( mean 32 months , range 14 to 59 ) , shorter ( mean 3.1 ht sds , range 2.1 to 4.1 ) , lighter   ( mean 2.5 wt sds , range 1.4 to 4.0 ) and had smaller heads ( mean 1.66 ofc sds , range 3.3 to 2 ) at the time of adoption than those who caught up ( table 4 ) .  \nthere were no significant differences in mean baseline growth factors in those who remained stunted compared to those who caught up .  \nthree of the children who had high risk for fas remained stunted at 6 months .  \nhowever , the degree of height cug ( delta ht sds ) in high risk for fas children was not statistically different from the larger cohort ( data not shown ) .   due to persistent short stature , children who did not catch - up by 6 months ( n = 6 ) were referred for pediatric endocrinology evaluation .   at the time of endocrine evaluation , five of these children\nthe four children who remained stunted , two were identified by provocative growth hormone stimulation testing as having growth hormone deficiency .   one female child with growth hormone deficiency , who was adopted at 14 months old and had associated optic nerve hypoplasia and fas , has demonstrated an excellent response to growth hormone therapy with height at the 25th percentile at last evaluation five years after adoption .\nthe pretreatment growth velocity was 6.8  cm / year ( gv sd not established ) compared to 12.3  cm / year ( + 2.96 sd ) after 1 year of treatment with growth hormone .\nthe other child a male who was 4 years old at the time of adoption with growth hormone deficiency was at low risk for fas and also demonstrated a good response to growth hormone treatment .\nthe pre - treatment growth velocity was 4.9  cm / year ( 0.82 sd ) compared to 6.9  cm / year ( + 2.12 sd ) after 1 year of treatment with growth hormone .\nhe is now growing along the 5th percentile at last evaluation on growth hormone therapy five years after adoption .  \nelevated tsh ( > 5 iu / ml , range 5.0611.60 ) was seen in international adoptees ( n = 18/110 , 16.4% ) at baseline with a normal free t4 level .   of the 18 children with elevated tsh at baseline , 6 had normal tsh at the 6-month follow - up ,\n7 had no follow - up tsh reported , and 5 had elevated tsh at the end of the study .   children with elevated tsh at the end of the study ( n = 5/110 , 4.5% ) were referred to a pediatric endocrinologist .\nin this prospective study of cug in children following international adoption , we found that significant growth failure was present at baseline as published before by the authors .   during the first 6 months after adoption , these children experienced substantial cug in length , weight , and ofc similar to previous cohorts [ 15 , 16 ] , and the degree of cug positively correlated with the young age and the time of adoption as observed by others\n. however , more than a third of children in this study did not show significant cug ( > + 0.5 sds ) during the 6-month follow - up period .  \n6.8% of children remained stunted ( < 2 ht sds ) at the end of the study , and two of these children were identified as having growth hormone deficiency .   older children with more severe baseline growth failure were more likely to remain stunted at follow - up .\nalthough our previous analyses showed that lbw , high risk for fas , and igfbp-3 were significantly and independently associated with height sds at the time of adoption , these variables were not significant independent predictors of subsequent height cug , which in the case of igfbp-3 was likely due to its correlation and colinearity with baseline ht sds .  \nchanges in igf-1 and igfbp-3 were positively correlated with linear growth , but were not independent predictors of growth restoration of adoptees .\ntherefore , it is likely that the improved nutrition and other changes , such as a more nurturing environment , have an important effect on the growth hormone axis influencing catch - up growth .   among the variables analyzed , only age , caloric intake ( per kg ) , and baseline height were found to be independent predictors of height cug .  \nprevious studies of cug following growth failure caused by other mechanisms have shown improvement in serum levels of components of the gh - igf system [ 17 , 18 ] . however , limited data are available on the role of gh - igf system in cug following adoption .\nwe found that although baseline serum igfbp-3 values correlated with the degree of linear growth failure   and igf-1 and igfbp-3 sds values improved in most children , neither igfbp-3 nor igf-1 was predictive of the degree of height cug in the first six months following adoption .\nthe finding that neither baseline growth factor levels nor the change in their values independently predicted the degree of cug in height was unexpected .    there are several potential explanations .\nit is possible that rapid changes in igf-1 levels could have occurred between the time that these children were united with their adoptive parents and when the igf-1 values were measured in the clinic .\nalternatively , low levels of igfbp-3 may primarily reflect baseline growth hormone status in some patients .  \nimprovement in igfbp-3 over time may improve the delivery of igf-1 to the target tissue .  \nfinally , it is possible that other related factors , such as baseline height or caloric intake , are more important than these growth factors in this early , rapid cug phase .  \nthese relationships suggest that although growth factors improve during this period , recovery from growth failure related to international adoption is a complex phenomenon that is dependent upon a number of factors and not solely related to restoration of normal function of the gh - igf system per se .  \ngrowth failure at the time of international adoption could represent a combination of malnutrition , reduced growth hormone secretion , and/or growth hormone resistance as observed in other conditions .\nfor example , children who suffer from intrauterine growth retardation have been shown to have growth hormone resistance , but normal growth hormone production . in psychosocial short stature ,\nreversible suppression of growth hormone secretion may also occur in hyperphagic short stature , which is a condition associated with disordered eating behaviors ( stealing food , hoarding food , foraging for discarded food ) that are commonly seen in institutional settings [ 21 , 22 ] .  \naccess to sufficient macro- and micronutrients to support growth is critically important and , worldwide , the most common cause of growth failure during childhood .\nnutritional demands vary depending on growth rates at different stages of development and any preexisting deficits due to pre- or postnatal malnutrition . during the most rapid growth phase between birth and 18 months the effects of even modest nutritional deficits\nmay become magnified in children within institutional care settings .   in this study , we found that 10% of the children were wasted ( wt < 2 sds ) on arrival that relative caloric intake was unusually high at baseline and substantially increased in most children .\nthe degree of cug for height and weight was related to calorie intake both at arrival and at six months .\nin addition , we have previously shown a high incidence of iron deficiency at adoption that persists at six months despite iron intake that is above the recommended daily allowance .\nthese findings emphasize the role of adequate nutrition support for cug in international adoptees and highlight the need to monitor feeding issues that could impact nutritional intake .\nwe found that the growth hormone axis , as measured by igf-1 and igfbp-3 , may be suppressed at baseline following international adoption .  \nage and severity of growth failure at the time of adoption are independent predictors of the degree of subsequent cug .\nlbw and high risk for fas , associated with baseline growth failure , are not significant predictors of the degree of subsequent cug , although a third of children who remained stunted after six months had facial features suggestive of fas .\nas nutritional intervention appears to be extremely important during the first 6 months after adoption , we recommend that adoptive parents be made aware of the need for increased calories beyond typical age requirements .\nif growth failure persists after 6 months of appropriate caloric intake , nutrition - independent causes should be considered , for example , growth hormone deficiency .\nthe older , the more severely stunted at the time of adoption , and those who are high risk for fas should be monitored most closely .", "human": " children raised in orphanages frequently experience growth suppression due to multiple risk factors . \n placing such children in more nurturing environments through adoption leads to significant catch -

{"article": "alzheimer s disease ( ad ) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive and functional impairment and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia ( bpsd ) .\nthese neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly include delusions , hallucinations , agitation , disinhibition , apathy , irritability , anxiety , depression , sleep disturbances , and elation .\nbpsd are highly common in severe dementia , with 90% of individuals exhibiting at least one behaviour . up to 50% of patients exhibit\nit has previously been shown that even modest improvements in these behaviours can result in significant improvement in the quality of life ( qol ) for the patient .\nalthough there is still a lack of agreement about how qol should be defined and measured , it is generally considered to be a multidimensional construct that includes the individual s subjective experience of life , as well as objective criteria related to activities valued by society .\nengagement in positive activities , presence of positive affect , absence of negative affect , participation in meaningful activity , and a sense of community are assumed to be correlated with qol in late - stage dementia .\nthere is a growing consensus about the need to measure qol in dementia trials , as such assessments allow researchers to evaluate the benefits and harms of a treatment and elements of health not detected by standard clinical outcomes .\nhowever , it is very difficult to determine qol in persons with late - stage dementia as they can not communicate reliably and are not involved in activities widely accepted by others as rewarding . due\nthe severity of cognitive impairment of patients with moderate to severe ad , assessment must rely on proxy reports or direct observation .  \nunfortunately , both of these approaches tend to exclude consideration of the patient s subjective experiences , which many believe to be an inherent feature of qol .\nthe quality of life in late - stage dementia ( qualid ) scale was originally developed by weiner and co - workers in 2000 .\nthe qualid is a late - stage , dementia - specific questionnaire with a one - week window of observation .\nit provides information about the patient s quality of life through assessments made by proxy informants .\nthe scale consists of 11 items , comprising both positive and negative dimensions of concrete and observable mood and performance , thought to be indicative of qol in late - stage dementia .\nthe items are rated by frequency of occurrence on a five - step scale , and scores are summed to range from 11 ( best qol ) to 55 ( worst qol ) . while the qualid scale has been shown to obtain reliable estimates of qol and validated in patients with severe dementia residing in long - term care facilities , little is known about the scale s responsiveness to change due to therapeutic intervention .\nthe objective of this study was to assess the responsiveness of the qualid scale to changes in bpsd due to a therapeutic intervention in a population of long -

term benefits from decreased behavioural problems are washed out by deterioration in overall health status over the long term .\nthe population in the previous study included 31 late - stage dementia patients residing in long - term care facilities who were given either olanzapine or risperidone .\nthe patients had a mean baseline qualid of 30.94 and mean npi of 53.48 , both of which are higher than those of the current study and other papers that have studied the qualid scale .\nthis study design reflects a more realistic timeframe for a therapeutic intervention , and is comparable to many other studies using antipsychotics , with a drug that has been shown to improve behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad .\nthe population is similar to most other studies in terms of mean qualid and mmse scores , even though the npi scores were slightly higher than those previously shown .\ntherefore , this analysis presents an appropriate design for a study involving patients with moderate to severe alzheimer s disease residing in long - term care facilities and , as a result , should provide more applicable conclusions regarding the responsiveness of the qualid scale to change when a therapeutic intervention is implemented .\nit is also unclear whether family caregiver assessment of qol would differ from nurses assessments .\nit is possible that results attained from the qualid scale are accurate , and that to make an impact in patients qol over the long term , larger changes in behaviour , cognition , and function are necessary .\nanother possibility is that the effects of memantine were not strong enough to elicit a change in qol in the long - term , despite significant improvements in behaviour rating scales .\nanother limitation is the fact that the majority of the patients in this study were male , and therefore the results may not necessarily be applicable to the general population of institutionalized patients with dementia .\nhowever , gender does not appear to have a significant effect on quality of life in those with dementia .\nwhile one study did find that being female was a significant predictor of lower quality of life as measured by the qualid , there was no difference between males and females in actual qualid scores , and the authors did not consider the results robust .\nit is also unclear whether family caregiver assessment of qol would differ from nurses assessments .\nit is possible that results attained from the qualid scale are accurate , and that to make an impact in patients qol over the long term , larger changes in behaviour , cognition , and function are necessary .\nanother possibility is that the effects of memantine were not strong enough to elicit a change in qol in the long -

{"article": "out - of - hospital cardiac arrest is still a major public health issue , claiming hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide yearly .\nbystander - initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) is essential to increase the chance of survival and neurological recovery . despite huge efforts to train laypeople to recognize and treat cardiac arrest , incidence of bystander\nreluctance to perform mouth - to - mouth ventilation is one of the major reason . whereas cpr including ventilation is still considered the gold standard approach before advanced life support can be instituted , a growing number of studies compared a simplified form of cpr , based on chest compression alone versus standard cpr including ventilation .\nanimal studies showed no difference in survival   or even worse outcomes   when ventilation was added to chest compressions ; nevertheless , in animal models of cardiac arrest due to respiratory causes a positive effect of ventilations was demonstrated . in humans ,\nobservational studies of bystander - initiated cpr comparing standard and compressions - only cpr reported similar survival rates ; however , interpretation of the results is made difficult due to the high heterogeneity of the causes of cardiac arrest and of the rescue characteristics .\nchest compression - only cpr is simpler than standard cpr to teach ( during courses but even by dispatchers under real conditions ) , and likely a higher percentage of bystanders would accept to perform it while avoiding mouth - to - mouth contact : the demonstration that it is ( at least ) as effective as standard cpr can be crucial to improve survival rate in out - of - hospital cardiac arrest .   with the underlying hypothesis that out - of - hospital cardiac arrest bystander - initiated compression\n- only cpr is equivalent to cpr including ventilation ( standard cpr ) , we performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta - analysis of randomized controlled trials , focusing on survival at hospital discharge .\npertinent studies were independently searched in biomedcentral , central , and pubmed ( updated september 1 , 2010 ) by several trained investigator .\n( cpr or resuscitation ) and compression and breath * and cardiac and arrest and survival )  . further hand or computerized searches involved the recent ( 2008 -

compression - only was associated to increased survival at hospital discharge ( 211/1842 [ 11.5% ] vs 178/1895 [ 9.4% ] , rr=1.24 [ 1.01 - 1.54 ] , p=0.04 ) ( figure 2 ) .\nforest plot for the comparison of standard cpr vs compression -

compression - only .\navailable evidence from randomized controlled trials strongly supports the superiority of bystander - initiated compression - only cpr , given that patients who experienced out - of - hospital cardiac arrest could be saved by limiting cpr to chest compression .\nthese results are crucial to significantly improve the first response to out - of - hospital cardiac arrests , a worldwide major public health problem .\nprevious findings from observational studies in humans   documented that spontaneously performed ( i.e. , not dispatcher instructed ) compression - only cpr was as effective as standard cpr . in the sos - kanto study , including witnessed cardiac arrests , compression - only cpr resulted in a higher proportion of patients with a favourable neurological outcome than standard cpr in patients with apnoea , shockable rhythm and resuscitation started within 4 minutes ; ventilations did not add benefits in any subgroup . on the contrary , two recent nationwide observational studies   conducted in japan concluded that standard cpr should be preferred in out - of - hospital cardiac arrests of noncardiac origin , both in adults and in children ; in this group , the two cpr techniques were similarly effective for arrests of cardiac origin . among the tree randomized controlled studies included in this meta - analysis , only one study   included paediatric patients < 8 years old , but results of this subgroup were not separately reported ; the study by rea et coworkers reported a tendency towards a worse efficacy of compression - only cpr than standard cpr in cardiac arrests of noncardiac origin , and a tendency towards a better efficacy in shockable rhythm and in rapid ( < 6 minutes ) response by the emergency medical system\n.   the results of the present meta - analysis are consistent with the most recent observational study on 4415 cardiac arrests not due to trauma or asphyxia , drug overdose or drowning , in which a 5-years data collection was accompanied by a statewide public education campaign aimed to increase bystander compression - only cpr . in this study ,\nthe incidence of bystander - initiated cpr increased every year , as did the proportion of compression - only cpr ; more importantly , overall survival increased significantly over time .\noverall survival to hospital discharge was equal between the no bystander cpr and the standard cpr groups , while survival and neurological outcome were significantly better in the compression - only cpr group ; compression - only cpr resulted particularly effective when the cardiac arrest was witnessed and presented with a shockable rhythm . in 1128\npatients with cardiac arrest of presumed noncardiac origin , not included in the study , survival was lower and not different among the two technique and no bystander cpr .  \nit is well documented that both interruptions of chest compressions during ventilation and positive -pressure ventilations have detrimental effects on survival rate .\noxygenation and ventilation could be allowed -

life of pct ( 18 to 24 hours ) , in absence of a further insult that might induce pct production .\nour findings , along with those in cardiac surgery   strongly support the contention that the  dynamic \napproach   may be more reliable that the static one ( that is the absolute single pct value ) especially in the challenging conditions characterized by a systemic inflammatory response , such as cardiac surgery and cardiogenic shock . indeed , in a cohort of unselected critically ill patients , jensen et al .  \nobserved that a pct increase was an independent predictor of 90-day survival and that the pct day - by - day changes was able to identify critically ill patients at a higher risk of icu mortality . on the other hand ,\nthe initial  ct level did not predict mortality , even though many patients were admitted with a pct 1.0 ng / ml .\nthis suggests that several pct measurements should be made consecutively to assess the critically ill patient s infection -

dominated locality just inland from the coast of pernambuco .\nspecifically , we collected at the small , rural settlements of refrigerio and tranquilidade ( 82259s 352709w , 289  m ; figure 1 ) . the sampling covered 9 months of 2009 ( january , february , march , april , june , august , october , november ) .\nwe used 10 cdc light traps   per night on 3 - 4 nights , for a total of 255 trap - nights over the course of the study .\none cdc light trap inside domiciles , and four in peridomicile ( including animal shelters ) , and five in nearby forested areas .\nthe traps were positioned 1.5  m above the ground on the edges of banana plantations or atlantic forest fragments , in the interior of forest fragments , and around human domiciles and associated structures ( stables , granaries , etc . ) .\neach site was visited every second month , and the two sets of sites were sampled in alternating sets of months to maximize numbers of sites included in the study .\nan initial analysis of temporal dimensions sandfly abundance in this study has already been published .\nthe location of each trap was georeferenced using a hand - held garmin ( etrex hc series ) global positioning unit , accurate to ~10  m on the ground using the datum wgs 1984 .\nthe species lutzomyia whitmani was analyzed separately from the other species occurring in the area because of its near - absolute dominance among the sandfly fauna of the region .\nwe used chi - squared tests to compare relative frequencies of different species in different environments , both in terms of numbers of individuals captured and numbers of sites at which the species were collected .\nwe compared l. whitmani with the remaining lutzomyia species except as constrained by sample sizes for the latter species ( expected frequencies had to be 5 for tests to be possible ) .\nall statistical tests were based on an  = 0.05 . to summarize dimensions of land cover and vegetation characteristics and phenology , we calculated the normalized difference vegetation index ( ndvi ) from landsat images available from the u.s .\ngeological survey ( http://glovis.usgs.gov/ ) with spatial resolution of 30  m ( 98  ft ) . specifically , we used images from the enhanced thematic mapper-7 sensor for the following dates : 3 october and 21 october 2006 , 15 april 2007 , and 8 august 2009 , which were the most cloud - free images available over the period 20062009 . to calculate ndvi\n, we used the formula 10,000[(b40  b30)/(b40 + b30 ) ] , where b40 and b30 represent the red and near - infrared bands from the landsat images , respectively . to identify environmental conditions under which lutzomyia species occur in the amaraj region , we used ecological niche modeling ( enm ) routines implemented in maxent . in general\n, we used default parameters to train models , so that we set the random testing percentage to 50% to provide an independent perspective on model quality ; we focused on the logistic output format . to identify environmental parameters most relevant to the species ' occurrence\n, we used a jackknife procedure that measures effects of each environment variable alone and when omitted from the model on predictions [ 27 , 28 ] . to separate areas predicted as suitable from those predicted as unsuitable , we set the expected meaningful error parameter of peterson et al .\nwe used as a threshold for separating prediction of suitability from prediction of unsuitability the highest logistic maxent suitability value that included ( 100e)% , in this case 98% of the training data , to take into account the possible presence of noise in the input data . to provide a quantitative test of model predictions ,\nwe were forced to focus on a subset of the study area , for which no cloud cover was present in at least two of the images ( figure 1 ) . to provide a clear test of predictive ability among spatial subsets , thereby avoiding some problems with spatial autocorrelation among training and testing data\n, we separated this subset of the study region into eastern , central , and western areas and challenged models to use each pair of areas to anticipate the distribution of the species in the third area .\nwe then used a receiving operating characteristic ( roc ) approach to provide a threshold - independent evaluation of each prediction .\nhowever , in light of known problems with standard roc approaches [ 31 , 32 ] , we used a partial roc approach , in which analyses are limited to portions of the roc curve in which omission error is less than or equal to e ; these tests were developed using a program developed by n. barve that is available upon request from the authors .\nthe test statistic output from these routines is the auc ratio , which compares the observed area under the curve to null expectations ; auc ratios are tested for difference from unity ( i.e. , random prediction ) via 1000 repetitions of a 50% bootstrap of available input data . finally , to provide a visualization of ecological niche patterns of lutzomyia species ' distributions in the study area\n, we developed a final niche model based on all occurrence data available across the three areas ( i.e. , no subsetting ) .\nwe combined ( grid combine in arcgis 9.3 ) this map with the environmental data layers from which it was derived to yield a raster dataset with an associated attributes table that includes the value of each combination of environmental variables ( ndvi of each time period ) and the prediction from maxent .\nthis table was exported in ascii format and used to develop various visualizations of niche patterns .\nwe identified 12 lutzomyia species in the amaraj study during 2009 , for a total of 1361 individuals across the 255 trap sites .\nlutzomyia whitmani was by far the most abundant species , totaling 1195 individuals ( 87.8% ; table 1 ) .\nother species recorded included l. evandroi ( 4.9% ) , l. quinquefer ( 1.9% ) , and l. complexa ( 1.3% ) , among others .   in peridomiciliary environments ,\nl. whitmani was even more dominant ( 98.2% of individuals ) ; l. evandroi , l. quinquefer , and l. migonei appeared to show a similar association with human - modified environments , albeit in much lower numbers .\nin contrast , l. complexa , l. tupynambai , l. sordelli , l. longispina , and l. walkeri appeared restricted to forest and forest edge in this study ( table 1 ) .\nthe concentration of l. whitmani in peridomiciliary environments was much greater than would be expected by chance ( p < 0.05 ) ; tests for the remaining species were equivocal , probably owing to small sample sizes . \n\ntable 1 shows the distribution of positive sites and individuals species in forested and peridomiciliary areas . among\nthe 120 sandfly positive sites , 82 ( 68.3% ) were in peridomiciliary areas , while 38 ( 31.7% ) were detected in forested areas ( p = 0.005 ) .\nl. whitmani and l. quinquefer were dominant in peridomestic sites ( p < 0.05 ) , as well as l. migonei ( p = 0.07 ) , while l. complexa , l. sordelli , and l. tupynambai were found almost exclusively in forested areas ( p < 0.05 ) . for all other species , distribution of positive sites among peridomiciliary versus forested areas could not be determined ( p  0.05 ) .\nl. whitmani was the most abundant species as well as the most broadly distributed across the study area .\nrelating patterns of occurrence to patterns of surface reflectance in the landsat imagery , the jackknife process indicated ndvi from october and april as the environmental variables most associated with presence of l. whitmani .\nndvi of march and august were omitted from models in light of their little contribution to fitness of models .\nniche models estimated from and projected among the three regions of the study area for which cloud - free imagery was available showed good ( i.e. , better than random expectances ) coincidence with independent testing data sets ( table 2 ) . in particular , for example , for l. whitmani , the model based on western and central regions predicted the distribution of the species in the eastern region with an auc ratio mean of 1.12 , which has an associated probability value of p < 0.001 .\nthe other two predictions were similarly statistically significantly better than random expectations ( table 2 ) thus amply confirming both the environmental influences on sandfly distribution and the predictive power of our models . \n\nfigure 2 shows the relationship between modeled distributions in environmental space of l. whitmani as opposed to the other sandfly species at amaraj , revealing differences in the distribution of species according to the vegetation index .  \nfigure 3 shows adding detail regarding presences detected for l. whitmani versus other species in forested and peridomiciliary environments .\nl. whitmani appears to be associated negatively with ndvi values ( both in april , which is the rainy season , and in october , which is the dry season ) , as areas predicted as unsuitable for this species show generally higher ndvi values ( figures 2 and 3 ) .\nmost other lutzomyia species , on the other hand , appear associated positively with denser vegetation ( i.e. , higher ndvi values ) in both seasons ( figures 3 ) .\noverall , then , lutzomyia species ' occurrences are associated with specific environmental combinations ( with contrast among species ) in amaraj .\nin the amaraj region as well as in other areas of brazil , lutzomyia whitmani has been implicated as the principal acl vector , predominantly associated with leishmania braziliensis , the main parasite species involved in transmission , although in southern region of the country it is considered only a secondary vector [ 3 , 13 ] . in amaraj , although 12 species were detected , l. whitmani was dominant constituting 87.8% overall of detections , and 95% in peridomiciliary locations .\nin forested areas , l. whitmani was less dominant ( only 41.7% of detections ) , and other species played more meaningful roles in the sandfly community .\nthis tie of l. whitmani to human - altered environments has been noted also in amazon basin , and in the center - west and southern parts of the country [ 10 , 11 , 14 ] .\nhowever , in a nearby region of pernambuco with greater forest cover , l. whitmani was found to be a relatively unimportant member of the sandfly community , and l. complexa and l. choti were much more numerous . among the other species detected at amaraj\n, l. evandroi and l. migonei both also appeared to be concentrated in peridomiciliary environments .\nalthough far less common than l. whitmani , the human association of these species makes them of some interest in acl transmission , as in other regions [ 11 , 34 , 35 ] . given its domiciliation and massive dominance , l. whitmani is almost certainly the major acl vector in the region [ 24 , 36 ] .\nwhile other species were rare around human habitations , this sand fly was more abundant in peridomiciliary and to a lesser degree forested areas , offering a possible vectorial role for other leishmania species in the wooded environments .\ndetection of l. whitmani in peridomestic and forested areas reinforces the assumption that deforestation does not result in decline of the species habitat but adaptation and/or tolerance of different vegetation type and climatic condition .\nclearly , the next step in this process would be detailed analysis of ( 1 ) blood meal sources for each sandfly species in the region , ( 2 ) detection of leishmania infections in the flies , and ( 3 ) identification and association of leishmania strains in both sandflies and locally infected humans .\nthis group of information , together with our spatial data , would offer significant insight into the details of acl transmission cycle in the region .\npredictive models relating species occurrences to abiotic variables have been used in several previous studies of distribution and ecology of vectors , reservoirs , and infectious diseases [ 10 , 21 , 37 ] .\nmost previous analyzes have been carried out at scales that are set by resolution of the available environmental variables of occurrence data [ 21 , 38 , 39 ] .\nhowever , climate of the relatively small area designated in this study does not vary much over scales like this . whereas the analysis of existing vegetation indirectly reflects the effects of rain and vegetation in the region , identifying ecologically disturbed and forested areas is of particular interest in the study of lutzomyia spp .\nthe amount of vegetation in the dry and wet seasons were adequate in predictions of species occurrence , particularly for l. whitmani , which could be analyzed in detail .\nfor this purpose , ndvi provides a good index of ecosystem function with strong correlation with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation . in spite the fact that l. whitmani has been associated with geoecological factors , this highly anthropophilic species is also influenced by socioenvironmental changes and transformation on landscape [ 10 , 34 ] , which were not evaluated in this study .\nthere was a negative association between this species and higher ndvi values ( denser vegetation ) , and predictions of the distribution of l. whitmani among regsions were statistically significantly better than random expectations .\nthis result strongly suggests that it is feasible to predict the distribution of this important vector in regions where it is difficult to perform sampling due to factors such as difficult access and financial restrictions .", "human": " the purpose of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution and population trends through time of lutzomyia species in a long -

membrane structure called an autophagosome , in which they are transported into the vacuole / lysosome to be degraded by resident hydrolases\n. such turnover of a large amount of cytoplasm mediated by autophagy is essential for survival under nutrient - depleted conditions .\nwe have isolated several genes essential for autophagy ( termed apg ) and have been investigating the function of the gene products ( tsukada and ohsumi 1993 ; funakoshi et al . 1997 ; matsuura et al .\n1998 ) . genetic and morphological analyses revealed that the degradative process of autophagy shares mechanistic components with the cytoplasm - to - vacuole targeting ( cvt ) pathway ( harding et al .\n; baba et al . 1997 ) , which is biosynthetic , delivering a resident hydrolase , aminopeptidase i ( api ) , to the vacuole ( klionsky and ohsumi 1999 ) .\non the other hand , autophagy and the cvt pathway are distinct in many aspects .\nthe two pathways appear to be regulated separately ; the cvt pathway is mainly observed under growing conditions , whereas autophagy is induced by starvation ( baba et al .\nfurthermore , cvt vesicles and autophagosomes , the vesicles formed in the cvt pathway and autophagy , respectively , are clearly different in size ( baba et al . 1997 ) .\nrecently , the t -

hybrid screening with apg1 as bait to identify apg1-associating proteins , which may regulate apg1 activity .\nthe following three genes were obtained from the screen : apg13 ( funakoshi et al .\n1997 ) and two novel genes , which were subsequently found to be essential for either autophagy or the cvt pathway , or both .\none gene , designated as apg17 ( ylr423c ) , was essential for only autophagy and was not required for the cvt pathway ( fig .\n2 a ) . the other , cvt9 ( harding et al . 1996 ; d.j . klionsky , personal communication ) , was required for the cvt pathway , but not for autophagy . among the 16 apg genes discovered so far ,\nit is interesting to note that apg1 binds to proteins whose function is specific to either autophagy ( apg17 ) or the cvt pathway ( cvt9 ) .\noverexpression of apg1 in an apg13 mutant partially rescues the autophagy defect ( funakoshi et al .\nsimilarly , the apg17 mutant was also rescued by overexpression of apg1 ( data not shown ) , indicating that these three genes interact functionally .\nin the apg13 mutant , attenuated apg1 activity was observed . in rapamycin - treated apg17 cells\n, apg1 activity also was found to be largely impaired ( 20% of the wild - type ) . on the other hand ,\ndeletion of cvt9 , which is not needed for autophagy , resulted in rapamycin - induced activation of apg1 to 50% of wild - type .\nthe effects of deleting apg13 and apg17 on apg1 activity are not the result of a general autophagy defect , because deletion of other apg genes , such as apg5 ( mizushima et al .\n1998 ) , does not affect the activation of apg1 ( data not shown ) .\nthese results indicate that the activated state of apg1 is required for autophagy induction , and that apg13 and apg17 play a key role in the activation of apg1 in response to tor inhibition .\nthe next question we addressed was how these apg1-associating proteins transmit the starvation signal from tor to apg1 .\noverexpression of apg13 resulted in a smeared apg13 band on the immunoblot caused by retarded migration , indicating that it was modified in some way ( fig .\nthis modified form was observed only in growing cells , and after starvation or rapamycin treatment , the slower - migrating form disappeared . in particular , it was noted that the disappearance of the slower - migrating form occurred within five minutes after rapamycin treatment . in vivo labeling and in vitro phosphatase treatment revealed that the apg13 bandshift was due to phosphorylation ( fig .\nthese results suggest that apg13 is phosphorylated in a tor - dependent manner , which was confirmed by the observation that dephosphorylation of apg13 in response to rapamycin was not seen in tor1 - 1 cells ( fig .\nthe dephosphorylated , faster - migrating form of apg13 in starved cells was rapidly phosphorylated after readdition of yepd medium ( fig .\n3 d ) , suggesting that the phosphorylation state of apg13 is extremely sensitive to nutrient conditions .\nthis excludes the possibility that the phosphorylated form of apg13 is degraded upon starvation and apg13 is de novo synthesized after medium addition .\nthe faster - migrating form of apg13 ( as well as the slower - migrating form ) was found to be labeled with pi ( fig\n. 3 b , lane 8) , suggesting that apg13 remains partially phosphorylated under starvation conditions . to confirm that there is a physical association between apg1 and apg13\na vacuolar protease - deficient strain was used for these experiments because apg13 is quite labile in cell lysate . when apg1 and apg13 were expressed from a high - copy plasmid , only the faster - migrating form of apg13\n3 e ) , indicating that the hyperphosphorylated form of apg13 has little affinity for apg1 .\nnext , we performed the experiment using a low - copy plasmid to more closely approximate physiological cellular conditions .\nthe amount of apg13 bound to apg1 increased rapidly ( as quickly as 10 min ) after rapamycin treatment ( fig . 3 f ) , which corresponds well to the time course of apg13 dephosphorylation .\nthese results strongly indicate that tor negatively regulates apg1 kinase activity by means of ( hyper)phosphorylation of apg13 , which reduces the affinity of apg13 for apg1 . from these results\n, we hypothesized that apg13 binding to apg1 is required for the induction of autophagy , but not for the cvt pathway .\nthe two - hybrid assay was used to determine the apg1-binding site on apg13 , using various apg13 open reading frame fragments as prey . a central 89-amino acid region ( 432520 )\nwe also isolated a cooh - terminal truncated form of apg13 , apg13(1448 ) , whose ser449 was mutated to a stop codon using in vitro mutagenesis ( kaiser et al .\nthis mutant has a mutation within the putative apg1-binding site , and is unable to associate with apg1 , as confirmed by the two - hybrid assay and coimmunoprecipitation ( fig .\n4 a , and data not shown ) . this result indicates a role for a domain of apg13 around amino acid 448 in binding apg1 .\nwe tested several cooh - terminal truncated apg13 mutants including apg13(1448 ) for autophagy activity .\n4 b , bottom ) , presumably due to the absence of the apg1-binding domain .\nanother cooh - terminal truncated form , apg13 ( 1568 ) , which contains the entire putative apg1-binding domain , displayed partial , but significant , autophagic activity , when compared with apg13(1448 ) .\napg13(1568 ) was less competent for autophagic import than full - length apg13 , suggesting that additional sequences downstream of the apg1 binding site are important for maximal activity .\non the other hand , apg13(1448 ) partially , but significantly , rescued vacuolar - targeting of precursor api ( fig .\n4 b , top ) , suggesting that this truncated protein is still functional for the cvt pathway .\napg1 activity in the apg13 mutant was partially restored in the presence of either apg13(1448 ) or apg13(1568 ) , and was fully recovered in the presence of the whole apg13 construct ( fig . 4 c ) .\nthe kinase activity of the apg13(1568 ) transformant was clearly higher than that of the apg13(1448 ) transformant .\nthese results confirmed the hypothesis that the apg1apg13 association and subsequent activation of apg1 are required for autophagy induction in response to starvation .\nit is currently thought that tor signaling in yeast is bifurcated ( thomas and hall 1997 ) .\none pathway involves the small gtpase rho1 , which is responsible for actin organization and is not affected by rapamycin .\nthe other involves tap42 , a rapamycin - sensitive phosphatase - associating protein that is necessary for the initiation of protein translation and amino acid permease turnover ( di como and arndt 1996 ) . tap42\nis known to be located directly downstream of tor , and is required for tor - mediated signaling , especially the rapamycin - sensitive branch ( jiang and broach 1999 ) . to investigate this issue further , we tested the ability of a tap42 mutant ( tap42 - 11 ; di como and arndt 1996 ) to induce autophagy at a nonpermissive temperature .\naccumulation of vacuolar autophagic bodies in tap42 cells was found to be comparable to that in wild -

human and human primates by aedes mosquitoes species .\nprevious authors report the probable existence of the chikv in africa for hundreds of years , with the first suspected epidemic documented in 1779 .\nsubsequent reports included outbreaks in nigeria ( 1964 ) , the ivory coast ( 1981 ) , and senegal ( 1983 ) associated with the west african strain .\nthe resurgence of chikungunya in the twentieth century was first documented in 1953 , in the newala district of tangaiynika ( tanzania ) .\nthe chikv continued to spread through the suspected vectors aedesfurcifer / aedescordellieri , to other south african countries , inclusive of rhodesia ( zimbabwe ; 1961 , 1962 , and 1971 ) .\nepidemics associated with the ecsa lineage subsequently occurred in cameroon ( 2006 ) and gabon ( 2007 ) with aedesafricanus and aedesalbopictus reported as the principal vectors , respectively . in gabon in 2007 , concurrent chikv and dengue fever epidemics were also experienced , with chikv transmission linked to the a.albopictus mosquito .\nthe iol strain originated in coastal kenya in 2004 and 2005 ( affecting 75% of the lamu island s population , via the vector aedesaegypti ) and then spread to the reunion island ( affecting one - third of the population ) and was subsequently introduced to other islands of the indian ocean and continental india , via the vector a.albopictus [ 1 , 57 , 12 ] .\nit is believed that the 2007 outbreak in italy was initiated through the importation of the chikv by a traveler from reunion island .\nother countries in which international travel facilitated the spread of chikv included france ( from travelers from reunion island ; 77% ) , comoros ( 14% ) , and mauritius ( 9% ) .\nautochthonous transmission in france , however , was not detected until the year 2010 , in association with a. albopictus .\nstudies have reported a high efficiency of transmission of chikv in the temperate climates by the a. albopictus species .\nthere are several aedes species which are competent in the transmission of the chikv , with a.aegypti and emerging populations of a.albopictus identified as responsible vectors in asia .\nthe asian strain identified in thailand in 1958 was transmitted by the suspected vector , a. aegypti .\nthis asian strain was also reported in outbreaks in india ( 19621965 ) and southeast asia ( 19581960 and 19621964 ) , also in association with the a. aegypti mosquito .\nepidemics of the 1980s and 1990s in southeast asian countries ( philippines , thailand , myanmar , and indonesia ) were associated with the asian endemic / epidemic chikv lineage . since then\n, the asian endemic / epidemic chikv lineage has continued to circulate sporadically , transmitted primarily among humans by a.aegypti and was again documented in the 2006 outbreak in malaysia [ 1 , 7 ] .\nemergence of an iol strain with resulting replacement of the endemic asian strain occurred during the southeast asia epidemics of 20062009 [ 1 , 7 ] .\nit is thought that the e1 envelope glycoprotein mutation of the endemic asian genotype resulted in the decreased adaptability of the chikv to a.albopictus , with decreased transmission , and the facilitation of chikv evolution and strain replacement .\nthe caribbean region continues to encounter challenges with the control of mosquito populations including a.aegypti and other aedes species .\nthe aedes mosquito was introduced to the caribbean through the african slave trade . following its introduction ,\na significant increase in the a. aegypti population density was associated with the intercontinental exchange activities of the second world war .\npublic health interventions of national health ministries and the pan american health organization in the 1950s and 1960s successfully reduced a.aegypti vector indexes by 1972 .\nthis success , however , was short lived and the re - infestations of the latin american and caribbean regions by a.aegypti in the late 1970s was accompanied by the introduction of a.albopictus in the early 1980s to some caribbean countries . although both a.aegypti and a.albopictus may be found in the caribbean , a.aegypti remains the principal vector responsible for the transmission of chikv and dengue in this region . to date\n, the chikv lineage identified in the 2014 caribbean outbreak belongs to the old asian lineage .\nthe presence of the asian lineage chikv , compounded by a nave caribbean population and high prevalence of a.aegypti , makes the probability of establishment of endemicity of chikungunya in the caribbean high .\nthis risk of establishment of endemicity extends to most tropical and subtropical regions of latin america areas and the southern usa , which is presently experiencing challenges with a.aegypti re -

infected caribbean territories was the usa .\nthe most likely cities to be travelled to from the caribbean were new york ( 13.8% ) , paris ( 11.7% ) , miami ( 7.8% ) and san juan , puerto rico ( 3.9% ) .\nit is expected that the change of climatic conditions , compounded by the increase of the warmer weather in temperate zones , will facilitate the further spread of this disease .\nthe months june through to november are designated as the  hurricane season  in the caribbean , or  the wet season  . the wet season has been shown to be associated with the increased breeding of the a.aegypti mosquitos .\nflorida reported its first two cases of autochthonous chikv transmission in july 2014 and , as of september 9 , 2014 , remains the only us state with autochthonous transmission .\nflorida now has eight cases of local transmission and 184 travel - associated laboratory - confirmed chikungunya cases as reported to arbornet .\nthe impact of the introduction of chikv into the caribbean region , a known tourist destination exchange of an estimated 20 million persons annually of which 9 million are us residents , remains to be seen .\nthe acquisition of chikv by travelers to the caribbean enhances the spread to neighboring caribbean countries and globally . as of epidemiological week 35 , among the caribbean countries affected , those with the highest incidence rates ( incidence/100,000 population ) include : guadeloupe ( 16,465 ) , martinique ( 15,087 ) , saint martin ( french part 13,401 ) , saint barthelemy ( 11,707 ) , dominica ( 5,068 ) , dominican republic ( 4,128 ) , and haiti ( 627 ) ( fig .  1 ) .\nthe emergence of chikungunya in the caribbean unfolds a story of the dynamic evolution and interaction of microbes and risk factors underlying the determinants of health .\nthe interaction of economic trade and its role in the transmission of vectors and infectious agents needs to be reviewed and policies reinforced and implemented .\n. continued education to increase the awareness of this disease is needed to curtail the population growth of mosquitoes and to mitigate the spread of chikungunya by travelers to the usa and other regions . improved awareness of the epidemiology and clinical manifestations\npreventative measures and epidemiological monitoring of the evolving chikv epidemic in the caribbean must be improved and sustained .\nthis article does not contain any new studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors . \n\nlizette mowatt and sandra t. jackson have no conflict of interest to declare with respect to this article .\nthis article does not contain any new studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors .\nthis article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution noncommercial license which permits any noncommercial use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original author(s ) and the source are credited .", "human": " chikungunya is a mosquito -

{"article": "imaging    techniques play an important role in the diagnosis , staging , and follow - up of cancer patients .   while standard imaging techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , are based on differences in the anatomical structure of the tissues , positron emission tomography ( pet )\nuses radiolabeled molecular probes to assess differences in biological or biochemical properties of tissues .  \nthe most commonly used tracer for pet is the glucose analogue 2-[f]fluoro-2-deoxy - d - glucose ( [ f]fdg ) , which provides an estimate of tissue glucose utilization .  \ntoday , [ f]fdg pet is widely used in clinical diagnoses of cancer , including lung cancer , non - hodgkin lymphoma , and glioblastoma .  \nbecause of this increased utility in oncology [ 57 ] , [ f]fdg pet is being evaluated as a tool to assess antitumor effects of standard or novel anticancer drugs in both human subjects and in animal models of cancer .  \npet imaging may provide evidence of biological responses of novel anticancer compounds , which , in turn , can facilitate the transition of compounds from preclinical to clinical investigation .  \none such novel compound is enzastaurin , which was developed as a protein kinase c - beta ( pkc- ) inhibitor .\nthe family of protein kinase c ( pkc ) has been implicated in processes that control tumor growth , survival , and progression .  \nin particular , pkc- activation has been recognized as an important contributor to malignant growth in diffuse large cell b cell lymphoma   and in glioblastoma .  \nrecently , enzastaurin has shown antitumor activity in xenograft models of the colorectal cancer cell line hct116 and in the glioblastoma cell line u87 mg .   while enzastaurin was designed as a selective pkc-   inhibitor , recent studies suggest that its antitumor activity is modulated by activation of gsk-3 and the pi3k / akt pathway .  \nin this study we evaluated the extent to which [ f]fdg pet imaging can accurately characterize the antitumor activity of enzastaurin in two different mouse xenograft tumor models .\nnonobese diabetic / severe combined immunodeficient ( nod / scid ) mice were raised and cared for by the indiana university simon cancer center transplant and xenograft core following the institutional guidelines of animal care .  \nthe glioblastoma cell line , u87 mg , and burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , raji , were obtained from the american type culture collection ( atcc , manassas , va , usa ) and cultured as recommended by atcc .  \nas previously published , u87 mg and raji cells express high levels of pkc- [ 12 , 13 ] .\ninjection , cells were resuspended in a 1 : 1 ratio of tumor cells : matrigel ( bd biosciences , bedford , mass , usa ) and burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , raji was resuspended in a 1 : 2 ratio of tumor cells : matrigel .  \neach mouse was injected s.c . in the right flank with 5  10 cells .  \nenzastaurin treatment was initiated when the tumors reached a volume of at least 150 mm .\nmice with similar tumor sizes were matched in the control and enzastaurin treated groups .  \nenzastaurin was suspended in 10% acacia ( fisher scientific , fair lawn , nj , usa ) in water and dosed by gavage twice daily at 75 mg / kg based upon weekly body measurements for each treated group .  \neach animal was anesthetized with acepromazine ( 1 - 2 mg / kg i.m . ) and torbugesic ( 2 mg / kg i.m . ) and placed on a custom bed for imaging .  \na static 15-minute pet study was performed using the indypet ii scanner [ 14 , 15 ] at 45 minutes posttracer injection .   following the pet study ,\nthe animal bed was moved to and mounted on an evs rs9 microct scanner , and a volumetric image that encompassed the tumor volume was imaged at approximately 90 micron spatial resolution .\nfdg utilization estimatesfdg uptake estimates are generated by placing rois on pet images acquired over the time period from 4560 minutes posttracer administration .  \nindices of tumor fdg uptake were generated by calculating a ratio of the tumor to muscle uptake and by calculating the standardized uptake value ( suv ) : \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ( 1)suvfdg=[4560ct(t)dt](id)/m . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t in ( 1 ) ct(t ) is the concentration of [ f-18 ] in the tumor from the pet image , m is the mass of the animal , i d is the dose of the tracer injected into the animal , and  is tissue density .  \n[ f]fdg was prepared by the hamacher method using a commercial synthesis unit provided by petnet / cti ( knoxville , tenn , usa ) .\nfdg uptake estimates are generated by placing rois on pet images acquired over the time period from 4560 minutes posttracer administration .  \nindices of tumor fdg uptake were generated by calculating a ratio of the tumor to muscle uptake and by calculating the standardized uptake value ( suv ) : \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ( 1)suvfdg=[4560ct(t)dt](id)/m . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t in ( 1 ) ct(t ) is the concentration of [ f-18 ] in the tumor from the pet image , m is the mass of the animal , i d is the dose of the tracer injected into the animal , and  is tissue density .  \n[ f]fdg was prepared by the hamacher method using a commercial synthesis unit provided by petnet / cti ( knoxville , tenn , usa ) .\nendpoints included tumor volume via calipers , tumor volume via ct , pet - determined measures for tumor , muscle , tumor / muscle ratio ,   and a standardized measure of uptake .  \nchanges from baseline for each endpoint were analyzed for each cell line ( u87 mg , raji ) and each time point ( week 2 , week 3 ) using nonparametric statistical methods ( wilcoxon rank - sum test ) to compare treated versus control animals .   due to the exploratory nature of the analyses , p - values were used to indicate trends and potential future research hypotheses , rather than to test and confirm prespecified hypotheses .\nwe first investigated whether two tumor cell lines provided acceptable tumor growth in nod / scid mice to allow reproducible imaging with [ f]fdg pet ( figure 1 ) .  \nwe used u87 mg cells as a representative cell line for solid tumors , and raji as a model for hematologic cancers .  \nboth the u87 mg ( figure 1(a ) ) and the raji ( data not shown ) tumor types grew consistently in nod / scid mice prior to drug treatment and [ f]fdg pet imaging reliably detected glucose uptake in xenografts as determined by standardized uptake value ( suv ) ( see materials and methods ) . in these feasibility studies\n, we also found that suv correlated with u87 mg tumor size as measured by ct ( figure 1(b ) ) .   based on these preliminary observations of initial tumor growth , we elected to use both tumor cell lines to evaluate enzastaurin - induced metabolic changes as detected by [ f]fdg uptake .  \nenzastaurin - induced metabolic changes were evaluated using [ f]fdg uptake in two independent experiments for each tumor cell line , u87 mg and raji , respectively ( table 1 ) .  \nconsistent with previous studies in nude mice , enzastaurin induced tumor growth delay in nod / scid mice implanted with u87 mg and raji ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .  \nu87 mg cells grew slower than raji cells , and enzastaurin had a tumor growth delay mainly in the u87 mg tumor cell model ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .  \na significant tumor growth delay was seen in u87 mg after treatment with enzastaurin over the period of 3 weeks ( figure 2(a ) ) .   in the raji xenograft model\n, there was a trend in the tumor growth delay , but not a statistically significant difference between vehicle and enzastaurin - treated groups ( figure 2(b ) ) .\n[ f]fdg pet   imaging was evaluated using suv ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) and tumor / muscle ratio ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) .  \nenzastaurin administration did not alter tumor glucose metabolism as measured by suv changes in u87 mg xenografts ( figure 2(c ) ) .  \ncompared to raji , the suv changes in u87 mg xenografts occurred at smaller signal intensities , and thus contributed to an overlap of suv measurements between vehicle- and enzastaurin - treated mice ( compare figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) .   in raji , suv uptake appeared to be increased at weeks 2 and 3 in enzastaurin - treated compared to vehicle - treated mice ( p < .10 at weeks 2 and 3 ; figure 2(d ) ) .  \nit is possible that metabolic heterogeneity of the tumor glucose metabolism in different areas of the tumor may have caused this difference in suv uptake .  \nin addition to suv , we also used tumor / muscle ratio to determine the metabolic effect of enzastaurin in tumors .  \nthe tumor / muscle ratio   uses muscle tissue with its low metabolic rate to normalize the tumor tissue [ f]fdg uptake .   based on this analysis\nthere was no clear evidence of a metabolic change induced by enzastaurin compared to vehicle treatment ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) .  \nhowever , for u87 mg there was a trend in fdg uptake in enzastaurin - treated mice ( p < .10 at week 3 ) , which was not observed in raji xenografts ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) , resp . ) .  \nafter enzastaurin treatment , we observed a trend in tumor size reduction for raji xenografts but not for u87 mg xenografts at week 2 ( p\nwhile the collective analysis of all animals from 2 independent experiments did not reveal a clear distinction between enzastaurin- and vehicle - treated animals , there were some animals that did show a metabolic change after enzastaurin treatment .  \nin these cases we saw a decline only after two weeks of treatment that was essentially undetectable after the third week of treatment ( figures 3(a)3(f ) and figures 4(a)4(f ) ) .  \nthe changes observed in u87 mg were different from changes observed in raji .   in u87 mg xenografts , [ f]fdg uptake declined after the 2nd week of treatment .  \nthe raji tumors were fast growing and had large areas of necrotic tissue and some areas with newly increased [ f]fdg uptake ( figure 5 ) .\nthe growth pattern of these tumors is partly responsible for the intertumoral heterogeneity seen in this study and may contribute to the lack of detecting enzastaurin - induced changes in the tumor .\nin this study we   used a specialized pet imaging approach which was developed to assess activity of anti - cancer agents in small animals .  \nchanges in [ f]fdg uptake were generally found to correlate with reduction in tumor size as determined by caliper measurements [ 17 , 18 ] .  \nour study uses a metabolic kinase inhibitor to compare drug - mediated tumor growth reduction with metabolic alterations in vivo . while previous imaging studies evaluated anti - tumor activity of cytotoxic agents , it is not clear how [ f]fdg pet imaging can help determine antitumor activity of kinase inhibitors .  \nin addition to its cost , the use of pet imaging may be limited due to the spatial resolution of current pet scanners .  \nthus , few studies have been published which evaluate the use of small animal imaging in drug discovery .  \nfor the first time , we assessed the anti - tumor activity of the serine / threonine kinase inhibitor enzastaurin by [ f]fdg uptake in mice .   because we used nod / scid instead of conventional nude mice\n, we first confirmed that [ f]fdg pet images could reproducibly be obtained in xenografts of glioblastoma and lymphoma .  \nthis feasibility assessment was important to establish the tumor size at which [ f]fdg uptake is detectable in mice .\ntumors had to be at least 150 mm in volume to be visualized by the scanner , and the best assessment was observed in tumors that were more than 400 mm ( figure 1 ) .  \nthis is consistent with other studies which reported on the need of specific tumor sizes for scanner assessment .\nthe subsequent studies with enzastaurin treatment did not provide clear evidence of enzastaurin - induced metabolic changes in either of the two tumor types examined .  \nhowever , there are several possibilities why enzastaurin - induced changes were not detected by [ f]fdg pet imaging .   \nfirst , it is possible that enzastaurin may not have a homogenous impact on the metabolic rate in the tumor tissue .  \nalthough pkc isoenzymes have been implicated in cell proliferation , their specific role during glucose metabolism is still not understood .  \non one hand , glucose can induce pkc- expression , and on the other hand , overexpression of pkc- reduces glucose uptake in cells .   hence , selective pkc- inhibitors have been investigated as potential treatments for diabetes .   whether such a pkc--dependent glucose regulation exists in tumor cells is not known .  \nconsidering the observation of this study , in which tumor growth delay and glucose metabolism are not correlated with enzastaurin activity in xenograft tumors , it is possible that enzastaurin is not able to modulate the complex glucose regulation in the tumor cells .  \nrecently , the antiangiogenic kinase inhibitor azd2171 was also evaluated in a small animal study for its metabolic change in tumors .  \ncompared to [ f]fdg pet imaging , only [ f ] fluoromethane proved as a useful tool to assess the anti - tumor activity of azd2171 .\ntherefore , it appears that only some kinase inhibitors will have metabolic changes in tumors , which can be assessed by [ f]fdg pet imaging .\nimplanted tumors tend to grow initially along the skin surface and infiltrate the underlying tissue to a lesser extent .  \nthis observation might explain why perhaps the caliper measurements can be used to demonstrate anti - tumor effects while the imaging of the deeper tissue by [ f]fdg or ct is not able to detect differences of treatment effect .   because of the inability to delineate clearly the borders of the infiltrating tumor tissue , the current study may underestimate the metabolic change and thus lead to false - negative imaging results .   in some animals , we used contrast dye to delineate better the tumor border in mice .  \n, future studies will need to be conducted with contrast imaging techniques to approximate the anatomical borders of the tumor .  \ntumor weight did not correlate with caliper measurements , because ct scans or caliper measurements were taken during the course of the study , while tumor weight was collected only at the end of the study , when animals were sacrificed , and tumors had become heterogeneous . finally , the observed [ f]fdg uptake signals are considerably lower relative to what is measured in humans .  \nthe low baseline level in the present xenograft study negatively impacted the ability to assess early changes in metabolism associated with treatment effect .  \nother factors influencing the low uptake signal are heterogeneity of glucose uptake in tumors , possible emergence of drug - resistant tumor cells , variability of pharmacokinetic exposure of the inhibitor , and the diffusion of tracer to the tumor site .   in summary ,\nour data are consistent with the hypothesis that shrinking tumor size ( assessed by caliper measurements ) does not equate to reduction in overall tumor metabolism .\nin fact ,  pockets  of drug - resistant tumor cells with increased glucose uptake and growth kinetics may become prevalent in certain areas of the tumor , while glucose reduction will be present in other areas .  \nadditional longitudinal pet imaging studies will have to examine in detail the variables which affect the accurate measurement of tumor response to drug treatment .  \nour study implies that [ f]fdg pet imaging will be useful only in a select type of tumors and perhaps detect antitumor activity only for a limited number of drugs .", "human": " \n background . \n the use of 2-[18f]fluoro-2-deoxy -

{"article": "an 81-year - old female with oavs presented to a general dentist for a dental implant consultation .\nher medical history was remarkable for an epibulbar dermoid and previous grafting of an anterior mandibular defect at the age of 16 .\nafter a routine examination , the patient was referred to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for implant treatment planning .\nthe surgeon requested a maxillofacial cbct scan extending from the level of the nasal fossa through the inferior border of the mandible , and from the anterior border of one ramus to the anterior border of the contralateral ramus . upon radiographic examination ,\nthe bilateral paramedian area of the mandible appeared abnormally heterogeneous with a poorly defined border on the right .\nthe mandibular canals anterior to the right second molar and the left mental foramen were untraceable ( fig .\n1 ) . multiplanar reconstructions revealed a large , heterogeneous , expansile entity of mixed density along the facial side of the mandible , extending from the mandibular left premolar area to the mesial aspect of the mandibular right third molar , and from the level of the root apices through the inferior border of the mandible .\neffacement of the facial cortical plate without an effect on the neighboring teeth was observed ( fig .\n3 ) . three - dimensional volume rendering depicted the considerable size of the entity in question ( fig .\n4 ) . a cartilaginous neoplasm could not be ruled out based on cbct imaging and an incisional osseous biopsy was therefore performed .\nhematoxylin and eosin - stained slides prepared after formalin fixation and decalcification were reviewed ( fig .\ngrowth or overgrowth is a recognized sequela of ccgs . almost all patients that seek corrective surgery following ccg overgrowth in the mandibular body or condyle present with facial asymmetry .\nthis happens even when the grafts are placed bilaterally due to their unpredictable growth potential . for a definitive diagnosis to be made , radiographic examination followed by a histopathological evaluation is indicated.9 most of the published cases of ccg overgrowth in the mandible were described radiographically using panoramic images and/or multi - detector computed tomography ( mdct).10111415161718 yang et al.9 reviewed 68 cases of ccg overgrowth in the maxillofacial region .\nthe authors described a case of overgrowth of a ccg that replaced the right mandibular body using panoramic , lateral cephalometric , and posteroanterior skull radiographs , and mdct .\nnone of the radiographs demonstrated asymmetry due to the inherent limitations of this imaging modality .\nmdct allowed better visualization of the facial deformity and chin deviation in all dimensions.9 the advantage of the 3-dimensional visualization of such complex cases using mdct is indisputable .\nhowever , plain radiography is still commonly used due to its availability , low cost , and reduced patient exposure to ionizing radiation .\nthe authors reported 4 cases that demonstrated low - attenuation grafts with occasional foci of high attenuation , clear borders between the graft and host bone , and lateral and superior rims of ossification using mdct .\nthe follow - up period of these cases ranged from 5 months to 8 years .\na clear border was only seen in the case in which only 5 months had elapsed since surgery .\nfukuta et al.16 published a case of recurrent overgrowth of a ccg placed for hemimandibular reconstruction using panoramic images , mdct , and a nuclear medicine bone scan .\nthese images were of poor quality , but the authors noted the deviation of the mandible on mdct on 2 occasions ( before each corrective operation ) and increased uptake of the radionuclide by the graft on the third day after surgery .\nthis profound growth potential may have been due to the patient 's young age ( 2 years old ) .\nsimilarly , samman et al.18 demonstrated an increase in isotope uptake by the graft using technetium scintigraphy , supporting the theory that ccgs have an inherent growth potential .\nkaban et al.11 described the incorporation and calcification of a ccg replacing the mandibular condyle , and ultimately resembling a normal condyle upon periodic follow - up .\nunfortunately , the quality of the images was poor in the previous articles , which made us unable to evaluate the imaging findings .\neckardt et al.10 described a case of ccg reconstruction after hemimandibulectomy in which follow - up was performed at regular intervals , up to 6 years after surgery , using panoramic images .\nthe authors used linear and angular measurements to calculate the ratio between the operated and unoperated side to evaluate overgrowth versus growth retardation .\nalthough this approach is inaccurate , as panoramic images are prone to positioning errors and unpredictable distortion between successive images and within the same image;19 significant growth of the ccg along the vertical dimension was evident .\nko et al.13 accurately used landmarks on lateral and posteroanterior cephalometric radiographs to assess ccg growth .\nthe authors noted that the follow - up period was critical when evaluating overgrowth ; the longer the follow - up period , the more growth they found in their sample .\njang et al.20 described the case of a ccg extending from the angle of the mandible and replacing the condyle using ct .\nthe graft appeared stable with no signs of resorption or overgrowth at 10 months after surgery .\nschatz and ginat8 pointed out that autografts have the disadvantage of resorption hindering their cosmetic effect .\nthe authors demonstrated a low - attenuation cartilage graft with a peripheral rim of ossification using an axial mdct image .\nkaracaolan et al.21 also demonstrated that cartilage grafts had a tendency to undergo resorption , using magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) after a 12-month follow - up period to assess the degree of resorption .\nthe majority of the grafts had a low signal with a few foci of high signal near the soft tissue periphery on follow - up imaging .\nno article in the literature described similar growth or changes in synthetic cosmetic implants in the soft tissue .\nhowever ; cosmetic implants , like autogenous grafts , can become incorporated into the underlying bone .\nother complications associated with cosmetic implants include migration , extrusion , erosion , and foreign bone reaction.8 with the increased use of radiographic imaging to diagnose and treat a variety of dental and medical conditions , there is an increased likelihood of incidental findings , such as implants that were not expected based on the patient 's history .\na history of implants for cosmetic purposes may not be elicited because the patient may not feel that they are important to the issue being discussed .\nalthough most implants and grafts will present as benign - looking entities within the soft tissue that can easily be interpreted as such , some may present as unusual entities that may mimic a more serious disease , such as a benign or malignant neoplasm .\nthe common management of facial defects in oavs includes reconstructive surgery , often using implants or grafts to improve patients ' cosmetic appearance .\nwe present the case of an incidentally found cosmetic graft . according to the patient ,\nan autogenous rib graft was harvested and sectioned to augment the mandibular symphysis . on imaging ,\nattempts to recover previous medical and surgical notes were unsuccessful , as the surgeon who performed the procedure in 1950 was deceased .\nthe exact surgical technique used was unclear ; however , the graft had maintained its proper anatomical location and aesthetic shape for over 65 years .\nthe most probable surgical technique may have involved the surgeon dicing the osteocartilage into multiple pieces and creating a tunnel between the mandibular periosteum and overlying mucosa to hold the diced cartilage graft in place during the healing period.21 to our knowledge , this is the last published case of an anterior mandibular costochondral graft . no case with long -

{"article": "  in recent years , with economic development and social modernization , the number of diabetic patients has been increasing worldwide , including developing countries , posing a global problem in terms of human suffering as well as medical costs [ 1 , 2 ] . the international diabetes federation ( idf ) estimated the number of diabetic patients to be 366 million in 2011 , and that it will reach 552 million by 2030 unless effective measures are taken .    at present\n, complex interactions between genetic factors and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of diabetes are undergoing extensive study .\nhowever , the relationships between genetic and environmental factors are difficult to verify , and direct obtainment of information from humans has intrinsic limitations due to significant ethical restrictions .\nthe use of experimental animal models is essential to resolve these problems , and results of basic research in animal models of diabetes may be useful to clarify the pathogenetic mechanism of human diabetes as well as the causes of complications and in the development of drugs for diabetes .\nin fact , many animal models of diabetes have contributed to clinical research of diabetes .\nit is important to develop animal models that correspond to various pathological conditions of human diabetes , and it is urgently necessary to develop models of diabetic complications that can reflect human diabetes , because the number of patients with type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) is rapidly increasing and progression of complications significantly affects the prognosis of diabetic patients .\nalthough there are many t2d model animals such as goto - kakizaki ( gk ) rats , zucker diabetic fatty ( zdf ) rats , and otsuka long - evans tokushima fatty ( oletf ) rats , and these animal models show diabetic complications , severe diabetic retinopathy has not been observed in the existing models . in these circumstances ,\nspontaneously diabetic torii ( sdt ) rat ( figure 1 ) has been established as a model of nonobese t2d with three major complications , including ocular complications [ 46 ] .\nthis paper provides an overview of the findings from sdt rats such as pathology of diabetes .\n  in 1988 , shinohara found five nonobese diabetic rats with polydipsia , polyphagia , polyuria , and sugar urine among approximately 12-month - old elderly male sprague - dawley ( sd ) rats , which were bred at the laboratory of torii pharmaceutical co. , ltd .\n( 305 males and 306 females ) after purchase from charles river laboratories japan inc . for long - term studies of spontaneous lesions .\nthese animals were mated with young normal female rats of the same strain to successfully generate diabetic f1 , and then attempts were made to preserve the diabetic trait in a closed colony ( figure 2(a ) ) . in 1991 , some animals in the diabetes - preserved colony developed diabetes at 4 to 5 months of age , leading to sib mating based on positive urine sugar in male rats . in 1997 , a new inbred strain of nonobese t2d rats was established and named sdt rat [ 46 ] . in the process of strain breeding ,\nthe prevalence of diabetes in male rats was 90% or more in the f4 generation and 100% in the f9 and subsequent generations .\ndiabetes tended to occur earlier in later generations and occurred at approximately 4 months of age in the f7 .\nthis strain of rats was characterized by the development of diabetes only in males since its discovery , but the disease was sporadically observed in females aged 9 months or older in the f7 and subsequent generations . currently , sdt rat is distributed by clea japan , inc .\n  a clear sex difference is observed in the onset of diabetes in sdt rats ( figure 2(b ) ) .\nwhile males developed diabetes at approximately 20 weeks of age with a cumulative incidence of 100% at 40 weeks , females developed it at 45 weeks with a cumulative incidence of as low as 33% at 65 weeks .\nit is suggested that this sex difference may be partly attributed to estrogen , which inhibits the development of diabetes in females .\nthe survival rate at 65 weeks was 92% in males and 97% in females , showing that the rats survive hyperglycemia without insulin treatment ( figure 2(c ) ) .\nthe fasting and nonfasting blood glucose levels markedly increased at 20 weeks and thereafter , reaching 700  mg / dl or more at 30 weeks with polyuria characterized by severe sugar urine as well as polydipsia / polyphagia ( figure 2(d ) ) .\nin sdt rats , development of hyperglycemia may be more dependent on decreased insulin secretion than insulin resistance , as shown by the fact that the blood insulin concentration tended to be lower than that in normal sd rats even before the onset of diabetes , and marked hypoinsulinemia developed after the onset of hyperglycemia [ 8 , 9 ] , indicating that this strain of rat is a model of nonobese t2d associated with impaired insulin secretion . compared with normal sd rats , body weight and body - mass index ( bmi )\nwere similar before the onset of diabetes , but decreased with age after the onset ( figure 2(e ) ) [ 6 , 8 , 10 ] .\nit is clinically known that glucose tolerance decreases before the onset of t2d . in oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) in sdt rats ,\nglucose tolerance markedly decreased at least 2 months before manifestation of hyperglycemia ( around 14 weeks old ) , and the rate of rise in blood sugar level after glucose load increased with age . in male rats ,\nthe severity of impaired glucose tolerance before the onset of diabetes was closely correlated with the age at onset of disease .\nimpaired glucose tolerance was related to decreased insulin secretory response after glucose load , and decrease in the fasting plasma insulin concentration and loss of insulin secretory response after glucose load were observed after the onset of diabetes ( figure 3 ) [ 8 , 11 ] .\nin addition , the insulin secretion level in pancreatic -cells from sdt rats after glucose treatment markedly decreased at 12 weeks of age and thereafter compared with normal sd rats . likewise , the mrna expression levels for glut2 and glucokinase in the isolated pancreatic islets markedly decreased at 12 weeks and thereafter in sdt rats . in female rats ,\nglucose tolerance also decreased at 25 weeks and thereafter , but insulin was secreted after glucose load , indicating that some factors cause insulin resistance or insulin requirement in the females , unlike in the males .\nit has also been reported that increased insulin secretion from hypertrophic pancreatic islets delayed the onset of hyperglycemia in high - fat diet - fed sdt rats .   \nas for the biochemical parameters , urine protein , blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) , glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) , and triglycerides ( tg ) markedly increased with the development of hyperlipidemia at 35 weeks of age and thereafter .\nin male rats , the blood tg concentration after fat load was high with normal tg absorption from the small intestine before the onset of diabetes , suggesting that the tg clearance is already impaired before the onset of disease . it is also suggested that not only the impairment of tg clearance , but also increased tg absorption from the small intestine occurs after the onset of disease .\nin addition , increased tg absorption may result from the physical increase in tg inflow associated with diabetes - related hyperphagia - induced hypertrophy of the small intestine as well as the increase in enzymes involving in tg absorption in the small intestine [ 15 , 16 ] . plasma ghrelin levels , an orexigenic hormone , of sdt rats were significantly higher than those of sd rats at 38 weeks of age .\nactive ghrelin production and suppression of insulin or leptin may be concerned with diabetic hyperphagia . in female rats as well , free fatty acids and tg were higher at 25 weeks of age before the onset of diabetes , compared with normal sd rats .\nsdt rats fed high - sucrose diet showed dyslipidemia and insulin resistance ; however , the incidence of hyperglycemia was suppressed .\nthe milder degrees of pancreatic abnormalities in high - sucrose fed sdt rats may be considered as the reason .   as for the glucose metabolism - related enzymes in the liver , glucokinase mrna level and glycogen content in the liver decreased in sdt rats at 16 weeks of age , suggesting that glucose metabolism in the liver is already abnormal before the onset of diabetes .\nafter the onset of disease , mrna expression of gluconeogenesis enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( pepck ) , fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase ( fbpase ) , and glucose-6-phosphatase ( g6pase ) increased [ 15 , 19 ] .  \nin sdt rats , the number of pancreatic islets and the area of -cells decreased with almost normal glucose tolerance at 10 weeks of age , compared with normal sd rats of the same age .\naround 8 weeks , pancreatic islets with congestion and capillary dilation were sporadically found with those with hemorrhage and edema in the same sections ( figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) ) .\nlater , probably accompanying findings such as inflammation and fibrosis in or around the pancreatic islets extended , and fibrosis , hemosiderin deposition and marked decrease in -cells were observed in almost all pancreatic islets at 20 weeks ( figures 4(c ) and 4(d ) ) . in sdt rats that developed diabetes , atrophy of pancreatic islets occupied by collagenous fibers and virtual disappearance of -cells was observed ( figures 4(e ) and 4(f ) ) [ 5 , 6 , 8 ] .\nthese changes in pancreatic islets starting from hemorrhage were observed in female rats around the same time with those in males .\nhigher sensitivity to streptozotocin ( stz ) , that has selective toxicity to pancreatic -cells , is also suggesting a pancreatic weakness of sdt rats .   during the course of the disappearance of -cells ,\nno lymphocyte infiltration was observed , unlike in type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) models such as nonobese diabetic ( nod ) mice   or biobreeding ( bb ) rats , but the concentration of interleukin-18 ( il-18 ) , an inflammatory cytokine , transiently increased at 9 weeks , resulting in a corresponding increase in interferon gamma ( ifn- ) and nitric oxide ( no ) production by spleen cells and peripheral leukocytes , respectively , as well as macrophage infiltration around the pancreatic islet tissue . in sdt rats , the number of white blood cells is increased at 8 weeks .\nit was immunohistologically found that the il-18 receptor and inducible no synthase ( inos ) were expressed in pancreatic islet cells .\nthese findings indicate that the development of diabetes in sdt rats may be due to the damage of pancreatic islets resulting from a transient increase in the il-18 concentration through direct effects on the cells and secondary effects via local macrophage infiltration .  \npancreas transplantation is generally performed in patients with t1d , but exceptionally in those with t2d , improving insulin sensitivity in both cases . in sdt rats\n, it is suggested that the elimination of glucose toxicity following pancreas allotransplantation may induce the pancreatic expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 ( pdx-1 ) , a homeodomain transcription factor , inhibiting the destruction of pancreatic islets and promoting the regeneration of pancreatic islets and -cells [ 23 , 24 ] .\nbased on the results of genetic analyses using two control strains , seven quantitative trait loci ( qtls ) involved in the impairment of glucose tolerance are currently mapped on the rat genome ( table 1 ) [ 2527 ] . in a backcross experiment with brown norway ( bn ) rats ,\nqtls involved in the impairment of glucose tolerance in sdt rats were identified on chromosomes 1 , 2 , and x , which were named gisdt1 , gisdt2 , and gisdt3 , respectively .\nit is found that homozygosity or hemizygosity for the sdt allele in each of these qtls markedly increases the risk of hyperglycemia ( diabetes ) , and the interactions between the qtls synergistically worsen glucose intolerance . in an intercross experiment with f344 rats , furthermore , qtls involved in the impairment of glucose tolerance in sdt rats were identified on chromosomes 3 , 8 , 13 , and 14 , which were named dmsdt1 , dmsdt2 , dmsdt3 , and dmsdt4 , respectively . to evaluate the effects of these qtls on the development of diabetes ,\n test was performed using f2 rats with normal glucose tolerance and those with diabetes , showing that dmsdt1 is the most influential on the development of diabetes .\nsubsequently , congenic rats were generated by transferring dmsdt1 to f344 rats , and histological analysis was performed , revealing histopathological changes such as inflammation and fibrosis in the pancreas in the congenic rats .\nthese results show that dmsdt1 is the major locus responsible for pancreatic lesions in sdt rats .\n  of many diabetic ocular complications , retinopathy , cataract , and neovascular glaucoma ( hemorrhagic glaucoma ) are the most important clinically .\nsdt rat is the first diabetic model with all of these complications [ 5 , 6 , 2832 ] .   \nfurther progression of the disease was characterized by proliferative retinopathy , with tractional retinal detachment primarily in the optic disc due to fibrovascular membrane resulting from retinal neovascular vessels ( figure 5(a ) ) [ 5 , 6 , 2832 ] .\nthe vascular pathological examination by trypsin digestion method showed a few capillary aneurysms , but revealed capillary narrowing and pericyte loss in sdt rats ( figure 5(b ) ) . in fluorescein angiography\n, abnormal retinal vasodilatation was observed in some animals and may correspond to venous beading in human retinopathy [ 5 , 2832 ] .\nin addition , severe fluorescein leakage almost corresponding to the area affected by tractional retinal detachment [ 2832 ] ( figures 5(c ) and 5(d ) ) was revealed .\nthe prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 8% at 35 to 50 weeks of age , but increased to approximately 80% at 51 to 60 weeks and 100% at 61 to 82 weeks .   at 44 weeks\n, electroretinogram ( erg ) revealed the delay and reduction of oscillatory potentials ( ops ) and a- and b - waves [ 31 , 33 ] , as is the case with human diabetic retinopathy .  \nit is known that not only microangiopathy , but also neurodegeneration occurs in the human diabetic retina . in comparison of changes in the death of neuroretinal cells as well as expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap : a marker protein for glial cells ) and water channel aquaporins ( aqps ) over time in sdt rats , the aqp expression profile in astrocytes in the nerve fiber layer shifted from aqp-4 to aqp-1 in the retinas of sdt rats at 40 weeks , when the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells ( rgcs ) was accelerated .\naqp-0 was predominantly expressed in the bipolar cells of the nondiabetic rat , whereas it was also expressed in the retinal nerve fibers of diabetic rat .\nthe disrupted water transport between astrocytes and retinal nerve fibers may be associated with the apoptosis of rgc induced by diabetes [ 34 , 35 ] .   in sdt rats , the angiotensin ii ( aii )\nconcentration in circulating blood was low at 15 , 30 , and 45 weeks , but the angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) activity specifically increased in the eye without change in the aortic ace activity at 45 weeks . in addition , continuous treatment with aii resulted in increased retinal expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) gene .\nthese findings suggest that specifically increased aii formation in the eye may play an important role in retinal vegf expression in sdt rats .\nfurthermore , advanced glycation end products ( ages ) such as carboxymethyllysine ( cml ) were expressed with vegf in the retina and may be involved in retinopathy in sdt rats . on the other hand ,\nangiogenesis was observed with vegf expression , but it has been reported that retinal neovascularization is not associated with retinal nonperfusion in sdt rats , unlike human diabetic retinopathy . unlike human diabetic retinopathy , the retinal capillary bed is hardly obstructed in sdt rats , indicating that increased expression of the pigment epithelium - derived factor ( pedf ) results in the suppression of diabetic retinal vascular disorder and less obstruction of the retinal capillary bed in sdt rats .    in human retinopathy , severely advanced retinal ischemia\nis finally associated with angiogenesis in the iris and anterior chamber angle , presenting with neovascular glaucoma . in sdt rats as well , advanced retinopathy is associated with fibrovascular membrane around the iris and sometimes with anterior chamber hemorrhage .\nneovascular membrane around the pupil may cause posterior synechiae and might develop neovascular glaucoma finally .\nsdt rat is a first model of iris neovascularization and consequent neovascular glaucoma [ 5 , 6 , 28 , 29 ] ( figure 5(e ) ) .   in male sdt rats ,\nthe prevalence of cataract is virtually 100% at 40 weeks of age . starting with opacity at the posterior pole of the lens ,\nthe findings of mature cataract are finally observed ( figures 5(f ) and 5(g ) ) .\npathological findings include swollen lens fibers , liquefaction , vacuolation , abnormal configuration , and formation of morgagnian droplets as well as partial proliferation of fibroblastoid cells .\nadvanced cataract is associated with capsular rupture , probably related to swollen lens [ 5 , 6 , 2832 ] .   \nthese ocular complications in sdt rats have been shown to be prevented by normalizing blood glucose with insulin treatment or pancreas transplantation and demonstrated to result from the long - term exposure to high blood glucose [ 31 , 40 ] .\ncorneal disorder , optic neuropathy , and uveitis are also known as ocular complications in t2d . though uveitis is not observed in sdt rats , corneal disorder and optic neuropathy are not well investigated . in sdt rats\n, renal lesions appeared at 24 weeks of age , including the thickening of the glomerular loop and glycogen deposition in the tubular epithelium ( armanni - ebstein lesion ) , dilatation of the renal tubule lumen , and increased hyaline casts .\nas for the glomerular lesions , slight thickening of the loop was apparent at 24 weeks and consistent with mesangial proliferation as shown by pas , masson 's trichrome stain , and type iv collagen immunostaining ( figures 6(a)6(f ) ) .\nmesangial proliferation intensified with age , and nodular lesions ( kimmelstiel - wilson - like nodules ) suggestive of more severe glomerular lesions were slightly observed at 68 weeks ( figure 6(g ) ) . on the other hand , the renal tubular lesions markedly increased with age , with a severe increase in tubular glycogen deposition at 50 and 68 weeks ( figure 6(h ) ) . in addition , urine volume , urine protein , and urine albumin increased with blood glucose at 24 weeks and thereafter , and these changes may be consistent with the development and progression of renal lesions [ 41 , 42 ] .\nthese renal lesions were also improved by blood glucose control with insulin and thus shown to result from the exposure to high blood glucose [ 41 , 42 ] .   in a study evaluating the involvement of oxidative stress and no in the mechanism for the progression of diabetic nephropathy in sdt rats , the blood asymmetric dimethylarginine ( adma ) concentration and urinary excretion of oxidative stress markers 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( 8-ohdg ) and nitrogen oxide ( nox ) increased in sdt rats at 36 weeks , compared with insulin - treated sdt rats and normal sd rats .\nin addition , renal tissue analysis revealed glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial proliferation , and immunostaining analysis showed that the glomerular 8-ohdg , endothelial no synthase ( enos ) , and nitrotyrosine scores increased .\nin sdt rats , enos and no increased despite the increase in adma and may thus play an important role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy together with oxidative stress .\nmetformin , an amp - activated kinase ( ampk ) activator , decreased renal 8-ohdg levels and subsequent podocyte loss , in spite of the limited effects on hyperglycemia .  \nboth motor nerve and sensory nerve are impaired under in diabetes . in an electrophysiological and morphological study of diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( dpn ) in sdt rats ,\nthe motor nerve conduction velocity ( mncv ) was not different from that in normal sd rats until 6 months of age , but gradually decreased thereafter to 82% and 76% of that in normal sd rats at 10 and 12 months , respectively ( figure 7(a ) ) .\nincreased nerve sorbitol and fructose contents and decreased myo - inositol contents in sdt rats indicate that the polyol pathway is prominently involved in dpn .\nranirestat , an aldose reductase inhibitor ( ari ) decreased sciatic nerve sorbitol levels and improved impaired sciatic mncv .   in the sural nerve cross - section\n, no neurologic deficit was observed , but degenerated nerves increased in sdt rats . in morphometry ,\nthe myelinated nerve area was not clearly different between the two groups at 6 months , but decreased in sdt rats at 12 months compared with normal sd rats .\nthe number of blood vessels in the nerve sheath was not clearly different ; however , occluded / thickened epineurial arterioles were found in sdt rats ( figures 7(b)7(e ) ) [ 45 , 47 ] .\nthe increased intima possibly results decrease of nerve perfusion and may contribute to development of dpn in sdt rats . in summary , it is shown that sdt rats develop peripheral neuropathy associated with t2d after the onset of disease , including functional / morphological abnormalities of peripheral nerves and vascular lesions .   \nautonomic nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system and transmits impulses from the central nervous system to peripheral organ systems . in diabetes , autonomic nerve\nsymptoms probably due to diabetic diarrhea are observed in sdt rats . in charcoal propulsion test , gastrointestinal motility increased in sdt rats with higher fecal water content at 28 weeks of age\nin addition , jejunum and ileum weights and mucosal weight increased , and the lumen diameter and villous height were longer indicating that more nutrients are absorbed with longer villi in diabetes [ 15 , 16 , 48 ] .   in a study of voiding dysfunction in sdt rats ,\nvoiding pressure , voided volume per micturition , and intermicturition interval tended to increase from 22 weeks to 36 weeks of age compared with normal rats .\nimmunodeficiency , delayed wound healing , skin ulcer , and osteoporosis are well known . among these complications ,\nosteoporosis has been reported in sdt rat . in a study of bone lesions in sdt rats with focus on bone density and bone morphometry , bone formation and resorption decreased in sdt rats at 36 weeks of age compared with normal sd rats , but improved in insulin - treated sdt rats .\nbone density and strength also decreased in sdt rats compared with normal sd rats ( figure 8) .\nbone lesions in sdt rats were characterized by decreased bone density and low - turnover bone lesions , as seen with t2d primarily due to decreased insulin secretion , and improved with insulin treatment , indicating the deep involvement of diabetic pathology [ 50 , 51 ] .\nthe study treating carvedilol , a  blocker possessing an antioxidant effect , is also suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress on this low - turnover bone disease in sdt rats .\ncurrently , sdt rats are used for the development and application of several diabetic drugs .\nin addition to insulin [ 31 , 41 ] , sulfonylurea ( tolbutamide ) and dpp iv inhibitor ( jtp-76209 ) , -glucosidase inhibitor ( voglibose ) , sglt inhibitor ( phlorizin ) [ 15 , 54 ] , and perilla ( shiso ) tea   lowered the blood glucose level of sdt rats .   \nit has been reported that diabetic microangiopathy is caused by increased tissue protein kinase c - beta ( pkc- ) activity at high blood glucose levels . in sdt rats at 32 weeks of age , abnormal retinal function such as delayed ops in erg were observed .\nin addition , peripheral and autonomic neuropathies such as decreased caudal mncv , electrocardiographic coefficient of variation of r - r interval ( cvr - r ) , and thermal hypoalgesia were observed .\nthese diabetic complications were improved after 12-week treatment with a pkc- inhibitor jtt-010 . however , histopathological changes including retinal thickening primarily in the optic disc at 68 weeks of age were not improved .\nsince the tissue pkc activity increased after the onset of diabetes in sdt rats , jtt-010 may have suppressed diabetic neuropathy by inhibiting the pkc- activity .\nhowever , the retinal histopathological findings were not affected in sdt rats that developed diabetes along earlier , indicating that factors other than pkc- activation are deeply involved in the progression of ocular complications in sdt rats .\nbenfotiamine , a transketolase activator that reduces major pathways involved in diabetic microvascular complications ( polyol pathway , hexosamine pathway , age pathway , and diacylglycerol - protein kinase c ( dag - pkc ) pathway ) also exhibits effects on peripheral nerve function in sdt rats .   in a large - scale clinical study\n, it was reported that candesartan , an aii type 1 receptor blocker ( arb ) , inhibited the progression of retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients . in an efficacy study of an telmisartan for the progression of ocular lesions in sdt rats , the blood glucose level was not changed , but blood pressure was decreased by telmisartan . under these conditions , delayed ops and a - wave in erg were prevented by telmisartan . in fluorescein fundus angiography , fluorescein leakage in sdt rats was decreased by telmisartan , suggesting that the arb may inhibit the development of proliferative retinopathy in sdt rats .\nit has also been reported that arbs ( candesartan and olmesartan ) improved coronary angiogenesis , cardiomyocyte fibrosis , and hypertrophy associated with the progression of diabetes in sdt rats [ 59 , 60 ] .\nin addition , candesartan decreased the pentosidine , a biomarker for age , content in the lens / vitreous body in sdt rats at 44 weeks of age , and immunohistologically , it inhibited the accumulation of pentosidine in the retinal vascular wall and decreased retinal vegf mrna expression .\nthese findings indicate that arbs can inhibit the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy by inhibiting age formation .\nfurthermore , it has been reported that cataract and retinopathy in sdt rats were prevented by ari fidarestat   and ranirestat , age inhibitor aminoguanidine , and 1/ blocker nipradilol .  \nwith application of gene therapy , the soluble vegf receptor ( sflt-1 ) gene was introduced into the retina in sdt rats to evaluate the preventive effect of sflt-1 expressed in the retina against diabetic retinopathy . at 57 weeks of age , fluorescein fundus angiography revealed that the development of retinopathy was inhibited in the retina engineered to express sflt-1 using an adeno - associated virus ( aav ) vector as compared with the contralateral nave retina .\nsince the local introduction of sflt-1 gene in the retina with the use of an aav vector is effective in preventing the development of retinopathy in sdt rats , gene therapy for diabetic retinopathy with antiangiogenic factors will be a promising therapeutic option for human patients [ 65 , 66 ] .\nproliferative retinopathy , especially , resulting from retinal neovascular vessels is a unique characteristic of this model .\nin addition , diabetic neuropathy ( e.g. , mesangial proliferation , nodular lesion ) and diabetic peripheral / autonomic nephropathy ( e.g. , decreased ncvs , hypoalgesia , diarrhea , and voiding dysfunction ) seem to be caused by postprandial long - term hyperglycemia in sdt rats .\nbone disorder such as decreased bone density and low - turnover bone lesions are also observed . at younger age ,\nglucose intolerance , caused by pancreatic islet lesions with inflammatory cell infiltration and fibroblasts , is also a characteristic of this animal .\ntaking advantage of these features , sdt rat has been used for evaluating antidiabetic drugs and drugs / gene therapy for diabetic complications .\nalthough there are insurmountable discrepancies between human and rodents , sdt rat seems to be a better animal model of diabetes than other models .   in conclusion\n, findings indicate that the sdt rats should be a potential t2d model for studies on the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes and its complications .", "human": " the spontaneously

{"article": "as rising health care costs continue to draw attention , the rate of increase in medicare expenditures , which significantly exceeded those of the overall u.s . health care system ( 9.3 versus 6.9 percent in 2005 ) , is of particular concern to policymakers .\nthe escalation in medicare part a spending is consuming a greater share of federal revenue , and current projections suggest that medicare outlays will exceed dedicated revenues by 45 percent of total expenditures in 2012 with the hospital insurance trust fund remaining solvent until 2018 . underlying\nchronic conditions are a leading cause of illness , disability , and death among medicare beneficiaries and account for a disproportionate share of health care expenditures . while approximately 14 percent of medicare beneficiaries have heart failure , they account for 43 percent of medicare spending .\napproximately 18 percent of medicare beneficiaries have diabetes , yet they account for 32 percent of medicare spending .\nthus , to limit increases in overall program expenditures , congress is actively pursuing strategies to contain costs of the chronically ill subset of beneficiaries . with many approaches to chronic dm and little agreement on the most effective approach ,\nthe 2003 medicare modernization act included several demonstration projects to assess the various approaches and inform medicare 's chronic dm strategy .\nsection 721 of the act , known as mhs , tests one approach in which commercial vendors provide dm interventions to fee - for - service beneficiaries with chronic illnesses .\nthese 3-year demonstration projects were awarded to eight companies , with the first programs becoming operational in august 2005 , and the eighth and final program becoming operational in january 2006 .\nthe pilots follow a randomized - controlled design and require that vendors reimburse the medicare program in full if they are unable to achieve budget neutrality ( inclusive of vendor fees ) .\nwhile official results of phase i are not due for over a year , three vendors have withdrawn early ( lifemasters , mckesson , and cigna as subcontractor to healthways ) and , in the preliminary evaluation of the first 6 months , the remaining projects have failed to achieve medical cost savings in excess of vendor fees ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .\nthese early results lend support to a growing body of literature concluding that commercial dm programs do not generate medical cost savings.the u.s . congressional budget office ( 2004 )\nreview of the dm literature concluded that   there is insufficient evidence to conclude that disease management programs can generally reduce the overall cost of health care services .\nthe most recent review by mattke and colleagues , which included 317 individual studies , reported that \n when the costs of the intervention were appropriately accounted for and subtracted from any savings , there was no conclusive evidence that disease management leads to a net reduction of direct medical costs .\n at the end of phase i , cms will face the decision of whether to expand mhs to a second phase .\nif the early trends are indicative of the final phase i results , policymakers should consider the changes that must be made to the commercial dm model to improve the likelihood of achieving cost savings and then assess whether the model is sufficiently compelling , when compared to other chronic care management strategies , to justify pursuing it .\nthis article contributes to this process by describing the characteristics of the current commercial dm model that limit its ability to attain short - term medical cost savings and then discussing the changes required to overcome them .\nprior to the initiation of a dm program , three questions should be answered to inform dm program design and set realistic expectations for the outcomes that will be realized : ( 1 ) what is the timeframe over which medical cost savings are expected to be achieved ? ( 2 ) given this timeframe , which categories of medical costs have the potential to be reduced ? ( 3 ) is there sufficient opportunity in a given population to achieve this targeted reduction in medical costs ?\nthe current commercial dm model suffers from a mismatch between the expectation of a short - run return on investment and an intervention that targets medium to long - term medical cost savings .\nthus , the first step toward fixing the current dm model is to develop an internally consistent approach .\nthe answer to the first question should be guided by the financial requirements of the stakeholder seeking to pursue dm for their population .\nalthough savings can be realized in the short , medium , and long term from altering the course of disease progression , most payers seek a short - term return on their investments . for - profit organizations strive to maximize shareholder value and , along with nonprofit organizations , are hesitant to invest in long - term interventions when their population has significant turnover and they are not confident that the program will reduce medical costs .\nthe 3-year timeframe of the first phase of mhs reflects this focus on short - term medical cost savings . in the short term\n, reductions may be more easily achieved for certain types of costs incurred by chronically ill populations . in the commercially insured , medicare and medicaid populations ,\nthe single largest health expenditure is in patient utilization ( nearly 33 percent in 2005 ) with 13.3 percent of all emergency department visits associated with a hospital admission ( mccaig and newar , 2006 ) .\ndiagnoses for which timely and effective outpatient care reduces the risk of hospitalization ( billings et al . , 1993 ) .\nthe second and third largest health expenditures , physician and clinical services and prescription drugs , typically increase as part of successful interventions targeting chronic illness ( u.s . congressional budget office , 2004 ; linden , 2006 ; ofman et al .\n. therefore , the primary opportunity for commercial dm programs to realize short - term medical cost savings is via reductions in costly avoidable hospitalizations and the emergency department visits that often lead to them ( linden , 2006 ) .\nfurther , a focus on avoiding the first admission during the intervention period is critical given that hospitalizations for chronic illnesses are relatively rare events and individuals may only experience one hospitalization over the entire course of a program . if the first admission is missed , the dm program may not have another opportunity to reduce the participant 's medical costs . before initiating a dm program in a given population ,\na numbers needed to decrease ( nnd ) analysis should be conducted to assess whether there is sufficient opportunity for an intervention to achieve medical cost savings .\nan nnd factors in variables including population - specific hospitalization rates , average cost per hospitalization , and the fees that will be charged by the vendor to project the percent of hospital admissions that need to be prevented to achieve a given savings target .\ntwo recent studies using this analysis ( linden , 2006 ; linden and biuso , 2006 ) calculated that between 11 and 74 percent of hospitalizations needed to be reduced for a dm program to break even on fees .\nan nnd for the mhs projects estimates a 15-percent reduction in all cause hospitalizations and an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions ( congestive heart failure and diabetes ) to break even on fees alone ( table 1 ) .\nan nnd also informs the size of the population that should be included in a dm intervention and the fees that should be paid to vendors . the disease - specific hospitalization rate and\nthe percent of hospitalizations required to break even will vary in relation to the disease severity of the population ; in a sicker population with a higher attendant admissions rate , a lower percent of hospitalizations will need to be decreased to break even .\nhowever , a narrowly focused program targeting only the sickest patients addresses only a small fraction of the total disease burden and is unlikely to achieve the goals of dm at the population level . to determine a reasonable fee schedule\n, the percent of hospitalizations the vendor expects to decrease in the specific population should be estimated and then , given the client 's average cost of a hospitalization , fees should be set below the expected savings . under these two considerations , both dm vendors and their clients\nare best served by a program that is able to reduce the greatest percent of hospitalizations in the largest chronically ill population . to achieve this ,\neach of the three components of the typical commercial dm model must be successfully executed .\nfirst , individuals within the target population at risk for a near - term hospitalization must be accurately identified .\nsecond , they must be enrolled and actively participate in the program for a meaningful period of time .\nthird , the program must include interventions that modify or close deficits in participant and/or provider behavior ( i.e. , self - care and care - seeking behaviors and medical treatment or management ) that lead to near - term hospital admissions .\nas currently structured , the commercial dm model is not optimally executing any of the three components .\nthe typical approach , the barriers to realizing short - term cost savings , and recommendations to address the shortcomings are discussed for each component in the following section and summarized in table 2 .\ndm programs typically use medical claims to identify patients with a specific chronic condition who were hospitalized in the prior year and then target them to receive an intensive intervention of regularly scheduled outbound calls from clinical staff .\nparticipants with no medical claims for a hospitalization or emergency department visit in the prior year are classified as low risk and typically receive only quarterly mailings .\na recent study conducted in a large managed care population reveals the problem with this approach ( linden and goldberg , 2007 ) .\nmembers hospitalized for a chronic illness in a given year were categorized by prior year hospitalization status .\nthe claims - based identification and stratification methodology , identical to that typically employed by dm companies , showed that only 6.4 percent of patients hospitalized in the current year had been hospitalized in the prior year .\nthus , the vast majority of current year hospitalizations came from members who would have been misclassified by a dm company as low risk , unidentified due to lack of claims data , or newly enrolled in the health plan . had these members been enrolled in a dm program that targeted only high risk patients based on prior hospitalizations they would have received either a minimal intervention or no intervention at all , making it highly improbable that the program could have prevented their hospitalizations .\ndm programs are increasingly using predictive modeling to improve claims - based identification of individuals at risk for high medical costs .\nthese statistical models use past medical claims and other basic demographic data to predict future costs .\nhowever , it requires past claims history in order to achieve any reasonable degree of accuracy , and it still fails to incorporate many factors that explain health care utilization that are not reflected in administrative data , such as predisposing and enabling factors and perceived need . a recent study comparing the accuracy of several commercial models to predict high - cost participants based on their past claims history found that all models significantly underpredicted high - cost individuals and overpredicted low - cost individuals ( winkelman and mehmud , 2007 ) .\nthe best fitting model underpredicted costs by 73 percent in the highest cost percentile ( 99 - 100 ) and underpredicted costs by 52 percent in the 96 - 99th percentile of costs .\nthese models fared worse when no past claims history was available and therefore would be uninformative for new entrants to a population .\ngiven the importance for dm programs to prospectively identify individuals who will incur high costs in the near future , such low predictive ability can lead dm vendors to miss the patients most likely to have an acute episode in the near term . in light of these shortcomings , dm programs should look beyond claims data to other sources of patient data .\npsychometrically validated health risk assessments ( hras ) developed to predict future hospitalizations should be used in conjunction with claims - based models and they offer a compelling alternative when no claims history is available .\nseveral instruments have been developed specifically for the senior population ( boult et al . , 1993 ) and achieve reasonably good predictive accuracy ; the sensitivity - specificity tradeoff measured by an area under the curve is consistently around 70 percent ( wagner et al . , 2006 ) .\nat program initiation these surveys can be distributed at the population level to improve identification , and then readministered quarterly to find incident cases as well as track changes in risk status of previously surveyed participants .\nmany dm programs have such tools available but use them on a very limited basis ; thus , increasing their use would not require a fundamental overhaul of the identification approach and , if administered electronically , would minimize the incremental cost .\nthere are two other potential approaches to identify patients at risk for a near - term hospitalization .\na direct referral from the patient 's physician is the most accurate means of identifying suitable candidates for a dm program . despite the fact that many dm programs have a channel for such direct referrals , physicians rarely use them .\nphysicians may not be aware of patient eligibility for dm or may not support the program .\nthe broader issue of how to engage physicians in dm is discussed at the end of this section .\nelectronic medical records ( emr ) and other repositories of clinical data that include medication lists and laboratory values are rich sources of up - to - date patient information .\nhealth systems such as kaiser permanente rely heavily on their emr for such purposes ( hyatt , taylor , and budge , 2004 ) , but outside of integrated delivery systems , third - party access to emr data would have to be negotiated .\nthus , while both of these strategies are promising , under the current health care delivery system supplementing claims - based identification with hras is the most compelling approach to improve identification of high risk patients .\nthis process is labor intensive and time consuming , limiting the number of eligible persons that can be contacted in a timely fashion .\nfurther , people are often wary of discussing health - related issues with strangers over the telephone and potential participants must be convinced that the program is legitimate . in commercial dm programs ,\nenrollment rates are quite low and vary by disease , with asthma program enrollment rates averaging 10 percent and congestive heart failure program enrollment rates averaging 30 percent of the eligible population ( lewis , 2007 ) .\nvendors in the mhs project are strongly incentivized to maximize enrollment within the required opt - in approach and have achieved high enrollment rates in the first 6 months of the mhs projects ranging from 65 to 92.3 percent ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .\nhowever , mean time - to - agreement ranged from 37 to 100 days , revealing that in the best case it took over a month to enroll beneficiaries in the program .\nfurther , those agreeing to participate were considerably healthier compared to non - participants , indicating that the beneficiaries who could most benefit from dm require even greater effort to enroll .\nan hra is also helpful in the enrollment process as it identifies individuals who are ready to consider changing their health behaviors and as a result are more likely to enroll in the program .\nthe percentage of individuals in any given population that are ready to change their behavior is not easily quantified as it is highly dependent on how readiness to change is defined and differs by the particular behaviors that are targeted .\nmost survey instruments include questions based on prochaska 's ( 1979 ) stages of change psychosocial model for determining the level of readiness to change .\nparticipants who are at least contemplating change , once identified , should be contacted by program representatives trained in behavior change methods , such as motivational interviewing .\nsuch techniques help participants overcome ambivalence and increase likelihood of enrollment ( miller and rollnick , 1991 ) .\nrepresentatives who are not trained in these methods may be too directive or confrontational , which can reverse a prior commitment to change ( amrhein et al . , 2003 ) and discourage participation . given the expense associated with telephonic enrollment , programs implemented in large populations should consider the use of interactive voice recognition ( ivr ) or web - enabled technologies to maximize the outreach to eligible participants .\na tradeoff exists between the narrow - and - deep telephonic approach and the wide - and - shallow approach that ivr technologies facilitate .\nan optimal enrollment model would include a technologically - based outreach process that draws on motivational interviewing methods . however , this combination is not currently mature enough to be widely available .\nthus , the choice of approach should be driven by the broader decision on the size of the population targeted to receive the intervention .\nfor example , one employer - based program achieved a 90-percent hra response rate when a $ 500 rebate on medical premiums was offered , compared to a 20-percent response rate with no incentive ( finkelstein and kosa , 2003 ) .\na recent study demonstrated that even modest incentives were effective in motivating overweight employees to lose weight .\nafter 3 months , individuals who received $ 14 for their participation lost 4.7 pounds on average compared to only 2 pounds in the control group ( finkelstein et al . , 2007 ) .\nphysician incentives can further bolster enrollment by sharing the cost savings associated with the program or by providing a pay - for - performance initiative in which they are paid for enrolling and supporting their patients in the program .\nwhile incentives increase program costs , at the right level they may be offset by a concomitant increase in enrollment and active engagement assuming that the sub sequent intervention reduces medical costs .\nfor participants classified as high risk , most commercial dm programs share a common intervention approach focused on improving process measures ( e.g. , increasing regular testing of glycosylated hemoglobin [ hba1c ] in diabetics ) in order to avoid costly complications in the future .\nsince most process measures are performed periodically ( i.e. , diabetics should receive an hba1c test between two and four times per year ) , the core dm intervention is comprised of patient calls around the time that these tests should occur . a recent study conducted by healthways , inc .\nreported that program participants with diabetes ( 245,668 unique members with diabetes from 25 different health plans across the united states ) received no more than four calls in their first 12 months of the program ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) .\nwhile periodic calls to participants have proven adequate to elicit improvements in screening rates ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) , they are insufficient to pick up on signs that patients are at risk for a near - term emergency department visit or hospitalization .\nfurther , there is evidence to suggest that most clinical practice guidelines for chronic illnesses are not modified to consider the needs of older patients with multiple and complex comorbidities ( boyd et al . , 2005 ) .\nthus , it is possible that this emphasis on adherence to practice guidelines focuses on the wrong aspects of care for this population and may have a detrimental effect on outcomes .\nseveral interventions have been shown to be successful at reducing avoidable admissions , but they require a greater frequency of patient contact than is currently the norm .\nmost participants at highest risk of a near - term hospitalization need to be assessed daily .\none strategy is to use outbound calls conducted by individuals proficient in behavior change methodologies .\nremote telemonitoring ( rtm ) technology offers an alternative strategy for assessing patient status and is typically less costly than daily outbound calls . via rtm ,\nthe signs or symptoms of an impending acute exacerbation triggers an alert to a nurse who can respond immediately and triage the patient to the appropriate ambulatory care setting .\nfor example , daily monitoring of congestive heart failure patients catches symptoms including weight gain , lower extremity edema , and increasing dyspnea that are typically present in the 8 to 12 days prior to hospitalization ( schiff et al . ,\na recent systematic review of rtm reported that , in the majority of studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac diseases , rtm led to significant decreases in hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and length of stay ; studies of diabetes and hypertension had mixed results ( pare , jaana , and sicotte , 2007 ) .\nhowever , rtm is expensive and , in diabetes , it is estimated to cost between $ 300 and $ 400 per patient per year when sponsored by a physician practice ( adler - milstein et al . , 2007 ) .\nother interventions shown to reduce near - term avoidable admissions include the provision of seasonal influenza vaccinations ( nichol , baken , and nelson , 1999 ) and a monthly pharmacist review of a patient 's medication profile ( hepler and strand , 1990 ) .\nthe latter may substantially reduce avoidable hospitalizations caused by drug - related problems such as untreated indications , use of the medication without indication , improper drug selection , subtherapeutic dosage , overdose , adverse re actions , interactions , and failure to receive the drug ( strand , morley , and cipolle , 1990 ) .\none of the biggest challenges in commercial dm is engaging physicians to support the program .\nthese programs have little ability to collaborate with physicians , many of whom are skeptical of dm initiatives and view them as disruptive to the physician - patient relationship ( leider , 1999 ) . without explicit endorsement from their physician\n, many patients will not enroll or adhere to the intervention provided by the dm program ( leider , 1999 ) .\nthis is problematic as physicians are well positioned to identify potential participants and persuade them to participate in a dm program .\nfurther , when physicians are actively involved in the intervention process , it is more likely that a dm program will be able to effectuate sufficient change in a patient 's clinical condition to avoid an acute exacerbation .\na recent article on the role of physicians in dm reports several barriers to physician engagement including a lack of financial incentive , a lack of technology to facilitate communication , and the need for a trusted practice - based program champion ( kuraitis , 2007 ) .\nleider ( 1999 ) suggests five core strategies to achieve physician buy - in for disease management programs .\nthese include ( 1 ) educating physicians on the goals of the dm program , ( 2 ) identifying champions with positive views of the program , ( 3 ) setting clear goals and expectations for physicians who participate in the program , ( 4 ) demonstrating that a relatively easy program works before attempting a more complex or controversial program , and ( 5 ) sharing the gains by rewarding physicians for their time and effort supporting the program . while such strategies are likely to strengthen physician support of commercial dm , they raise the broader question of the appropriate role for each player in supporting chronic dm .\nsome view commercial dm companies as filling a gap in our acute care focused delivery system that has consistently failed to deliver high - quality care to those with chronic illnesses .\nhowever , the flaws of a third - party work - around are evident in the increased fragmentation of care that results from a lack of coordination between dm vendors and traditional care delivery settings . a compelling alternative is wagner 's chronic care model that includes a primary care - based medical home\n. proponents of this model believe that the primary care team is the entity best suited to deliver chronic care management ( geyman , 2007 ) . in this model\n, the primary care physician leads a team of specialists , nurses , dieticians , pharmacists , and health educators to provide and coordinate all the care for a chronically ill population .\nwith evidence of cost reduction and quality improvement from group health cooperative and kaiser permanente , primary case - based dm enjoys empirical support ( mcculloch et al . , 2000 ) .\nrecent pay - for - performance programs that attempt to align payment incentives with high - quality chronic care also reflect a belief that chronic care is the responsibility of physicians and the systems in which they operate ( rosenthal et al . , 2007 ) .\ndm programs typically use medical claims to identify patients with a specific chronic condition who were hospitalized in the prior year and then target them to receive an intensive intervention of regularly scheduled outbound calls from clinical staff .\nparticipants with no medical claims for a hospitalization or emergency department visit in the prior year are classified as low risk and typically receive only quarterly mailings .\na recent study conducted in a large managed care population reveals the problem with this approach ( linden and goldberg , 2007 ) .\nmembers hospitalized for a chronic illness in a given year were categorized by prior year hospitalization status .\nthe claims - based identification and stratification methodology , identical to that typically employed by dm companies , showed that only 6.4 percent of patients hospitalized in the current year had been hospitalized in the prior year .\nthus , the vast majority of current year hospitalizations came from members who would have been misclassified by a dm company as low risk , unidentified due to lack of claims data , or newly enrolled in the health plan . had these members been enrolled in a dm program that targeted only high risk patients based on prior hospitalizations they would have received either a minimal intervention or no intervention at all , making it highly improbable that the program could have prevented their hospitalizations .\ndm programs are increasingly using predictive modeling to improve claims - based identification of individuals at risk for high medical costs .\nthese statistical models use past medical claims and other basic demographic data to predict future costs .\nhowever , it requires past claims history in order to achieve any reasonable degree of accuracy , and it still fails to incorporate many factors that explain health care utilization that are not reflected in administrative data , such as predisposing and enabling factors and perceived need . a recent study comparing the accuracy of several commercial models to predict high - cost participants based on their past claims history found that all models significantly underpredicted high - cost individuals and overpredicted low - cost individuals ( winkelman and mehmud , 2007 ) .\nthe best fitting model underpredicted costs by 73 percent in the highest cost percentile ( 99 - 100 ) and underpredicted costs by 52 percent in the 96 - 99th percentile of costs .\nthese models fared worse when no past claims history was available and therefore would be uninformative for new entrants to a population .\ngiven the importance for dm programs to prospectively identify individuals who will incur high costs in the near future , such low predictive ability can lead dm vendors to miss the patients most likely to have an acute episode in the near term . in light of these shortcomings , dm programs should look beyond claims data to other sources of patient data .\npsychometrically validated health risk assessments ( hras ) developed to predict future hospitalizations should be used in conjunction with claims - based models and they offer a compelling alternative when no claims history is available .\nseveral instruments have been developed specifically for the senior population ( boult et al . , 1993 ) and achieve reasonably good predictive accuracy ; the sensitivity - specificity tradeoff measured by an area under the curve is consistently around 70 percent ( wagner et al . , 2006 ) .\nat program initiation these surveys can be distributed at the population level to improve identification , and then readministered quarterly to find incident cases as well as track changes in risk status of previously surveyed participants .\nmany dm programs have such tools available but use them on a very limited basis ; thus , increasing their use would not require a fundamental overhaul of the identification approach and , if administered electronically , would minimize the incremental cost .\nthere are two other potential approaches to identify patients at risk for a near - term hospitalization .\na direct referral from the patient 's physician is the most accurate means of identifying suitable candidates for a dm program . despite the fact that many dm programs have a channel for such direct referrals , physicians rarely use them .\nphysicians may not be aware of patient eligibility for dm or may not support the program .\nthe broader issue of how to engage physicians in dm is discussed at the end of this section .\nelectronic medical records ( emr ) and other repositories of clinical data that include medication lists and laboratory values are rich sources of up - to - date patient information .\nhealth systems such as kaiser permanente rely heavily on their emr for such purposes ( hyatt , taylor , and budge , 2004 ) , but outside of integrated delivery systems , third - party access to emr data would have to be negotiated .\nthus , while both of these strategies are promising , under the current health care delivery system supplementing claims - based identification with hras is the most compelling approach to improve identification of high risk patients .\nthis process is labor intensive and time consuming , limiting the number of eligible persons that can be contacted in a timely fashion .\nfurther , people are often wary of discussing health - related issues with strangers over the telephone and potential participants must be convinced that the program is legitimate . in commercial dm programs ,\nenrollment rates are quite low and vary by disease , with asthma program enrollment rates averaging 10 percent and congestive heart failure program enrollment rates averaging 30 percent of the eligible population ( lewis , 2007 ) .\nvendors in the mhs project are strongly incentivized to maximize enrollment within the required opt -

cause hospitalizations by about 15 percent to break even on fees alone .\nif dm can only impact congestive heart failure and diabetes ( the primary and secondary conditions targeted by mhs ) , the percentage decrease in hospitalizations needed to achieve the cost savings target lies closer to the 82-percent reduction estimate .\nthe mhs interim report reflected few statistical or substantive differences in the rate of hospitalizations , 30-day readmissions , and emergency room visits between the intervention and control group after 6 months .\nthus , in light of the dm model flaws , achieving a 15-percent reduction in all - cause admissions or an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions is unlikely for the current programs .\nif vendors implement the changes previously discussed , a sufficient reduction in hospitalizations may be achieved before the final mhs evaluation is conducted . however , this will require further investment in the interventions on top of the current monthly fees that range from $ 74 to $ 159 per beneficiary ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) . thus the question remains as to whether commercial dm can achieve net cost savings in the chronically ill population .\nultimately cms will have to assess the potential for commercial dm to be more cost effective than alternative approaches currently under study in other demonstration projects in deciding how to proceed with managing the chronically ill .", "human": " interim results of the medicare health support ( mhs ) demonstration projects suggest that commercial disease management ( dm ) is unable to deliver short -

up periods .\nsubjectively , no infants in either group developed recurrent gastroesophageal reflux or wrap failure during an average follow - up period of 22 months ( range , 1 to 54 ) .\nfollow - up length of time for the lnf group was not different from that in the onf group ( 1 to 28 months versus 1 to 54 months , respectively , p = ns ) .\nhowever , routine monitoring for recurrent reflux is not done at our institution unless an infant develops feeding intolerance after fundoplication .\nour results suggest that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication ( lnf ) is at least as safe and effective as open nissen fundoplication ( onf ) in the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in a population of infants with a history of a neonatal laparotomy .\nadditionally , lnf appears to have a distinct advantage by allowing an early resumption of full enteral feeds after nissen fundoplication .\nall of the infants in this study required an operation in the neonatal period for surgical diseases unrelated to gastroesophageal reflux .\nboth the onf and the lnf groups included infants with a variety of neonatal surgical diseases , many of which predispose to the subsequent development of gastroesophageal reflux .\nspecifically , there is a well - documented increase in the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in neonates with a history of gastroschisis , congenital diaphragmatic hernia , and omphalocele .\nthe risk for the development of gastroesophageal reflux in these infants is theorized to be secondary to defects of bowel motility , increased abdominal pressure , and gastroesophageal junction anatomical anomalies .\nat least half of the infants in both the onf and lnf groups had a variety of abdominal wall and diaphragmatic defects .\nthere have been few studies in infants and children that address the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal re -

existing gastrostomy tube did not preclude a safe and effective laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in children .\nvan der zee et al both documented the technical feasibility and safety of nissen fundoplication in children with a pre - existing gastrostomy tube .\nalthough these studies do examine redo laparoscopic surgery , none of these studies have examined the role of a laparotomy for primary neonatal surgical disease pre - existing the development of gastroesophageal reflux .\nthere are distinct nuances in achieving safe minimally invasive access in infants after neonatal laparotomy . for infants with abdominal wall defects\n( eg , gastroschisis and omphalocele ) , the umbilicus is avoided because the majority of these infants have dense adhesions in this area from prior repair . in our study , initial access for these patients was achieved through a left upper quadrant cut down approach with a 4-mm port . in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and intestinal atresia , adhesions from a prior laparotomy\nthus , access via the umbilicus was attempted and successful for these patients . for some patients ,\nextended operative times were due to optimizing port placement and extensive adhesiolysis to complete a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication .\nunfortunately , the actual times for this aspect of the study operations were not recorded separately , and therefore , we are unable to determine the exact time for doing the fundoplication portion of the operation . beyond the technical feasibility of a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication at any time point after a neonatal laparotomy\n, our study also highlights the feasibility of a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in a group of very small infants .\nspecifically , all of the infants in the lnf group underwent fundoplication at an average weight of 5.2 kg ( range , 2.7 to 8.8 ) .\nthese infants were , on average , smaller than the infants and children in the largest series of redo laparoscopic nissen fundoplication , in which the lowest documented weight was 6.4 kg .\nhowever , we are not aware of any studies that have examined weight as a selection criterion for redo laparoscopic nissen fundoplication .\nthe study dates include a period of transition in our institution with respect to surgical approaches to gastroesophageal reflux . in 2001 ,\nan experienced laparoscopic surgeon joined the surgical group , resulting in a gradual conversion over to advanced laparoscopic approaches to historically open surgical diseases .\nthe number as well as the approach for surgical anti - reflux operations at our institution increased and changed over the time period of this study from 41 in 2000 ( 37 onf ; 4 lnf ) to 122 in 2005 ( 118 lnf ; 4 onf ) .\nas advanced laparoscopic skills have developed in the group , the operative times for primary lnf have ranged from 45 minutes to 135 minutes , depending on staff and resident trainee experience .\nmore surgeons will now consider primary laparoscopic nissen fundoplication , even in the face of previous abdominal surgery .\nwe intend to review our experience for all anti - reflux operations in the neonatal age group or in infants under 7 kg to determine the outcomes and benefits of such an approach in this patient population .\ncurrently , a primary laparoscopic approach is our preferred approach to gastroesophageal reflux , regardless of the history of previous operations .\noutcomes following laparoscopic or open nissen fundoplication performed in infants after a neonatal laparotomy are similar .\nhowever , a laparoscopic fundoplication did allow for earlier return to enteral feeds compared with the open approach and tends toward shorter hospital length of stay .\ntherefore , we conclude that laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is technically feasible , safe , and effective in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants with a previous neonatal laparotomy .", "human": " background : nissen fundoplication is an effective treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants . \n laparoscopic procedures after previous laparotomy are technically more challenging . \n the role of laparoscopic nissen fundoplication after neonatal laparotomy for diseases unrelated to reflux is poorly described.methods:this was a retrospective review of open vs laparoscopic nissen fundoplication in infants after neonatal laparotomy . of 32 infants who underwent neonatal laparotomy , \n 26 required a surgical antireflux operation within the first year of life . \n twelve infants underwent laparoscopic nissen fundoplication versus 14 infants who underwent open nissen fundoplication . \n parameters like age , weight , operative time , number of previous operations , length of stay following fundoplication , time to feedings , and complications were compared between the 2 groups.results:no statistically significant differences existed between most of the parameters compared following laparoscopic vs open nissen fundoplication . \n no conversions to open procedures were necessary in infants undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication , and these infants resumed enteral feeds earlier than those who underwent the open procedure.conclusion:laparoscopic compared with open nissen fundoplication performed in infants after a neonatal laparotomy were comparable procedures across most data points studied . \n however , a laparoscopic fundoplication did allow for earlier return to enteral feeds compared with the open approach . \n laparoscopic nissen fundoplication is technically feasible , safe , and effective in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants with a previous neonatal laparotomy .

scores and life - long learning , employment , and social activities .\nfor instance , it is reasonable that people with physical disabilities may also need assistance ( in for example toileting or walking ) , while performing activities such as participating in educational activities ( life - long learning ) or participating in recreational activities ( social activities ) .\nin addition , the correlations between the bi and community living and health and safety exceeded the minimum criterion .35 .\nhowever , these correlations were still lower than the correlations reported in a study with people intellectual disabilities of harries and colleagues ( 2005 ) , who found higher correlations between these sis subscales and several subscales of the adaptive behavior scale ( abs ) and the inventory client and agency planning ( icap ) measuring practical skills ( abs self - sufficiency , icap motor skills and icap personal living skills ) .\ntherefore , compared to previous research , this study reveals a weak relationship between limitations in practical skills and support needs in specific sis domains , and additionally , construct validity was evidenced in only four out of eight sis subscales .\nan explanation for the weak relationship between the bi and the sis subscales could be that the sis subscales might have underestimated the limitations of practical skills associated with physical disabilities . in the study of harries et al .\n( 2005 ) , in which scores of the abs , icap and sis section subscales were combined in an explorative factor - analysis , it was found that the sis support need scale and these adaptive behavior scales had the same underlying construct .\nalthough initial analyses showed a strong association between sis subscales and the subscales of the abs and the icap , a three - factor solution showed that no sis subscales were present in the third factor , representing the practical dimension .\nthe outcomes revealed that ,  considered in terms of the three adaptive behavior skill areas , the underlying construct related predominantly to the conceptual skills dimension \nthe authors suggest that the raters used  an individual s conceptual skills as a framework of reference when assessing support needs  ( p. 402 ) .\nalthough harries and colleagues ( 2005 ) do not further explain this suggestion , it may be that the frame of reference is a bias in the sis itself .\nit might be that support needs , as measured by the sis , are based more on the limitations in conceptual skills ( e.g. , cognition and language ) rather than limitations in practical skills ( e.g. , mobility , bladder and bowel control ) . all subscales ( except the behavior subscale ) were intercorrelated in the moderate to high range , comparable to the outcome of buntinx et al .\nmoreover , the sis was able to discriminate between groups who varied in the number of disabilities .\nspecifically , the group of people with a physical disability and 2 or 3 or more additional impairments were rated as having higher support needs than people with only a physical disability .\nthus , the analysis of the construct validity reveals that the sis measured the overall construct of support needs in the current sample .\nhowever , in contrast to the expectation that the sis subscales would be related to the bi , this construct is only slightly based on limitations in practical skills\nfirst most of the participants in the sample were diagnosed with cerebral palsy and only a small proportion consisted of people with spina bifida and tbi .\nsubgroups consisting of people with spina bifida and tbi were too small to conduct separate analyses .\nfuture research is needed to investigate whether these groups differ in the nature of support needs .\nfor example , many people with spina bifida may need support related to bladder and bowel control and shunt - related problems ( oi et al . 1996 ) . in addition\n, people with tbi often need support in the behavioral domain ( soo et al .\ntherefore , future research of the sis should take into account other settings , such as ambulatory and semi - residential services .\nhowever , people with cerebral palsy often experience a decline in functional status and health status at a young age ( hemsley et al .\n( 2002 ) argue , support needs are proposed to be dynamic , which indicates that  they change across settings , across situations , and over time  ( p. 392 ) . for this reason ,\nequally important , in order to consider the changing nature of support needs in people with a physical disability , research should also focus on longitudinal assessments on individuals . in summary ,\nthe present research was the first attempt to measure the psychometric properties of the sis in people with physical disabilities .\nalthough there are some indications that the sis may be useful assessing support needs in people with physical disabilities , the sis might not take sufficiently into account the limitations in practical skills of these people .\nfor people with physical disabilities , future revisions of the sis should take into consideration limitations in practical skills in a variety of support domains as measured by the sis .\nfirst most of the participants in the sample were diagnosed with cerebral palsy and only a small proportion consisted of people with spina bifida and tbi .\nsubgroups consisting of people with spina bifida and tbi were too small to conduct separate analyses .\nfuture research is needed to investigate whether these groups differ in the nature of support needs .\nfor example , many people with spina bifida may need support related to bladder and bowel control and shunt -
